<div class="para">In this class, all rings have a multiplicative identity, written as 1 or <span class="process-math">\(1_{R}\)</span> is we want to emphasize that we are referring to the ring <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> This is what some authors call unital rings; since for us all rings are unital, we will omit the adjective. Moreover, we will think of 1 as part of the structure of the ring, and thus require it be preserved by all natural constructions. As such, a subring <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> must share the same multiplicative identity with <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> meaning <span class="process-math">\(1_{R}=1_{S}\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, any ring homomorphism must preserve the multiplicative identity. To clear any possible confusion, we include below the relevant definitions.</div>
