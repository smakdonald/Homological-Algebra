<div class="para">The theorem above is the theorem most commonly referred to as NAK. The proof involves only elementary tools, and a fun linear algebra-inspired trick called the Determinantal Trick. While we will not include the details here, they can be found in any standard Commutative Algebra book. We will however use this result to prove another statement that is also commonly referred to as NAK, which allows us to talk about minimal generating sets for finitely generated modules over local rings.</div>
