<div class="para">A representable functor encodes a universal property of the object that represents it. For example, in Example 1.46, mapping out of the singleton set is the same as choosing an element <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in a set <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> We have all seen constructions that are at first a bit messy but that end up satisfying some nice universal property that makes everything work out. At the end of the day, a universal property allows us to ignore the messy details and focus on the universal property, which usually says everything we need to know about the construction. And as you may have already realized, universal properties are everywhere. Before we give a formal definition, we want to discuss some important examples.</div>
