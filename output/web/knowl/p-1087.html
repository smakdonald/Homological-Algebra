<div class="para">The following is a classical result in commutative algebra, known by some as Nakayama’s Lemma. As noted in [Mat89, page 8], Nakayama himself claimed that this should be attributed to Krull and Azumaya, but it’s not clear which of the three actually had the commutative ring statement first. So some authors (eg, Matsumura) prefer to refer to it as NAK. There are actually a range of statements, rather than just one, that go under the banner of Nakayama’s Lemma a.k.a. NAK.</div>
