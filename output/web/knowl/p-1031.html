<div class="para">We proved above that every module <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is a submodule of some injective module. One can even do better and talk about the smallest injective module that <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> embeds in; this is called the injective hull <span class="process-math">\(E(M)\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> One could describe <span class="process-math">\(E(M)\)</span> by saying that it is the intersection of all the injective modules that contain <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> but this is not a very practical description. Injective hulls can also be described through the theory of essential extensions, a topic which we do not have time to discuss this semester. We leave the definition here just for fun, but we do not have the time to talk about it at length.</div>
