<div class="para">Many objects and concepts one might want to describe are obtained from existing ones by flipping the arrows. Opposite categories give us the formal framework to talk about such things. We will often want to refer to dual notions, which will essentially mean considering the same notion in a category <span class="process-math">\(\mathscr{C}\)</span> and in the opposite category <span class="process-math">\(\mathscr{C}^{\mathrm{op}}\text{;}\)</span> in practice, this means we should flip all the arrows involved. We will see examples of this later on.</div>
