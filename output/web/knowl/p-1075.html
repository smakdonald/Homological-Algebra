<div class="para">The story of the structure of injective modules then continues in a beautiful way. Over a noetherian ring, it turns out that every injective module can be decomposed into a direct sum of injective modules of the form <span class="process-math">\(E(R / P)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is a prime ideal in <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, the injective modules <span class="process-math">\(E(R / P)\)</span> are the indecomposable injective modules, so the basic building blocks of injective modules. One can in fact compute the injective hull of any finitely generated <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-module very explicitly. A lot of this was proved in Eben Matlisâ€™ beautiful PhD thesis [Mat58], but sadly we do not have time for the details this semester. The details, however, are very important, for example to develop the theory of local cohomology - a topic which we will briefly mention later on.</div>
