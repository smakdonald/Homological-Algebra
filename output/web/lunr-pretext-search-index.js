  "body": "Where are we going?  Chain Complexes and Short Exact Sequences  Homological algebra first appeared in the study of topological spaces. Roughly speaking, homology is a way of associating a sequence of abelian groups (or modules, or other more sophisticated algebraic objects) to another object, for example a topological space. The homology of a topological space encodes topological information about the space in algebraic language - this is what algebraic topology is all about.  More formally, we will study complexes and their homology from a more abstract perspective. While algebraic topologists are often concerned with complexes of abelian groups, we will work a bit more generally with complexes of -modules. The basic assumptions and notation about rings and modules we will use in this class can be found in Appendix A. As an appetizer, we begin with some basic homological algebra definitions.  Chain Complex   A chain complex of -modules , also referred to simply as a complex , is a sequence of -modules and -module homomorphisms such that for all . The maps are the differentials of our complex. chain complex  differential      We may sometimes omit the differentials and simply refer to the complex or even ; we may also sometimes refer to as the differential of .   Exact Sequences   The complex is exact at if im . An exact sequence is a complex that is exact everywhere. More precisely, an exact sequence of -modules is a sequence of -modules and -module homomorphisms such that for all . An exact sequence of the form is a short exact sequence, sometimes written ses. exact sequence  short exact sequence      The condition that for all implies that .    The sequence is exact if and only if is injective. Similarly, is exact if and only if is surjective. So is a short exact sequence if and only if    is injective     is surjective     .      When this is indeed a short exact sequence, we can identify with its image , and . Moreover, since is surjective, by the First Isomorphism Theorem we conclude that , so we might abuse notation and identify with .   We write to denote a surjective map, and to denote an injective map.   Cokernel   The cokernel of a map of -modules is the module      We can rephrase in a fancier language: if is a short exact sequence, then and .    Let be the canonical projection . The following is a short exact sequence:     Let be a polynomial ring over the field . The following is a short exact sequence:   The first map is multiplication by , and the second map is the canonical projection.    Given an ideal in a ring , the inclusion map and the canonical projection give us the following short exact sequence:     Let . The following complex is exact:     Indeed, the image and the kernel of multiplication by are both .   Sometimes we can show that certain modules vanish or compute them explicitly when they do not vanish by seeing that they fit in some naturally constructed exact sequence involving other modules we understand better. We will discuss this in more detail when we talk about long exact sequences.   The complex is exact if and only if is an isomorphism.    The complex is exact if and only if .    Homology  Historically, chain complexes first appeared in topology. To study a topological space, one constructs a particular chain complex that arises naturally from information from the space, and then calculates its homology, which ends up encoding important topological information in the form of a sequence of abelian groups.  Homology   The homology of the complex is the sequence of -modules   The th homology of is .     The submodules are sometimes called cycles , while the submodules are sometimes called boundaries . One sometimes uses the word boundary to refer an element of (an -boundary), and the word cycle to refer to an element of (an -cycle).    The homology of a complex measures how far our complex is from being exact at each point. Again, we can talk about the cohomology of a cochain complex instead, which we write as ; we will for now not worry about the distinction.    Note that is exact at if and only if .    Let . Consider the following complex: The image of multiplication by is , while the the kernel of multiplication by is . For all ,     Let be the canonical projection map. Then   is a complex of abelian groups, since the image of multiplication by is , and that is certainly contained in . The homology of is   Notice that our complex is exact at and . The exactness at says that the map is injective, while exactness at says that is surjective.   Before we can continue any further into the world of homological algebra, we will need some categorical language. We will take a short break to introduce category theory, and then armed with that knowledge we will be ready to study homological algebra.   "

  "title": "Categories",
  "body": "Categories         Most fields in modern mathematics follow the same basic recipe: there is a main type of object one wants to study - groups, rings, modules, topological spaces, etc - and a natural notion of arrows between these - group homomorphisms, ring homomorphisms, module homomorphisms, continuous maps, etc. The objects are often sets with some extra structure, and the arrows are often maps between the objects that preserve whatever that extra structure is. Category theory is born of this realization, by abstracting the basic notions that make math and studying them all at the same time. How many times have we felt a sense of déjà vu when learning about a new field of math? Category theory unifies all those ideas we have seen over and over in different contexts.  Category theory is an entire field of mathematics in its own right. As such, there is a lot to say about category theory, and unfortunately it doesn't all fit in the little time we have to cover it in this course. You are strongly encouraged to learn more about category theory, for example from [ML98] or [Rie17].  Before we go any further, note that there is a long and fun story about why we use the word collection when describing the objects in a category. Not all collections are allowed to be sets, an issue that was first discovered by Russel with his famous Russel's Paradox. The collection of all sets that don't contain themselves cannot be a set. Do you see why? Russel exposed the fact that one has to be careful with how we formalize set theory. We follow the ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel with choice, short for the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the Axiom of Choice) axiomatization of set theory, and while we will not discuss the details of this formalization here, you are encouraged to read more on the subject.   Definition and First Examples    We'll only use as much category theory as is necessary. Famous last words...   Roman Abramovich   A category consists of a collection of objects and arrows or morphisms between those objects. While these are often sets and some kind of functions between them, beware that this will not always be the case. We will use the words morphism and arrows interchangeably, though arrow has the advantage of reminding us we are not necessarily talking about functions.  Category   A category  consists of three different pieces of data:   a collection of objects ,     for each two objects, say and , a collection of arrows or morphisms from to , and    for each three objects , and , a composition         We will often drop the and write simply for .  These ingredients satisfy the following axioms:   The are all disjoint. In particular, if is an arrow in , we can talk about its source  and its target  as the objects such that .    For each object , there is an identity arrow  such that and for all and all .    Composition is associative : for all appropriately chosen arrows.        We sometimes write or for an arrow .   Unique Identity Morphism  Every object in a category has a unique identity morphism.      Here are some categories you have likely encountered before:  Categories    Category  Objects  Morphisms     sets  functions     groups  group homomorphisms     abelian groups  abelian group homomorphisms     rings  ring homomorphisms     -modules  -maps     topological spaces  continuous functions     While the collections of objects and arrows might not actually be sets, sometimes they are.  Locally Small   A category is locally small if for all objects and in is a set. A category is small if it is locally small and the collection of all objects in is a set.    In fact, one can define a small category as one where the collection of all arrows is a set. It follows immediately that the collection of all objects is also a set, since it must be a subset of the set of arrows - for each object, there is an identity arrow.  Many important categories are at least locally small.    is locally small but not small.     Categories where the objects are sets with some extra structure and the arrows are some kind of functions between the objects are called concrete.    All of the categories we have seen thus far have been conctrete, but this is not the case in general.  Non-Concrete Categories     Given a partially ordered set , we can regard itself as a category: the objects are the elements of , and for each and in is either a singleton if or empty if . There is only one possible way to define composition, and the transitive property of guarantees that the composition of arrows is indeed well-defined: if there is an arrow and an arrow , then and , so and thus there is a unique arrow . This category is locally small, since all nonempty -sets are in fact singletons. It is in fact small, since the objects are by construction the set .    For each positive integer , the category has objects and is either empty if or a singleton if . As , composition is defined in the only way possible, and things work out. This is the poset category for the poset with the usual .    Fix a field . We define a category with objects all positive integers, and given two positive integers and , the -set consists of all matrices with entries in . The composition rule is given by product of matrices: given and , the composition is the matrix . For each object , its identity arrow is given by the identity matrix.       A locally small category with just one element is completely determined by its unique -set; it thus consists of a set with an associative operation that has an identity element, which we call a monoid.    Diagrams and Morphisms    Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die.   Daniel Burnham   A key insight we get from category theory is that many important concepts can be understood through diagrams. Homological algebra is in many ways the study of commutative diagrams. One way to formalize what a diagram is involves talking about functors, which we will discuss in Section 1.2; here is a more down to earth definition.  Diagram   A diagram in a category is a directed multigraph whose vertices are objects in and whose arrows\/edges are morphisms in . A commutative diagram in is a diagram in which for each pair of vertices and , any two paths from to compose to the same morphism.    Commutative Diagram  The diagram   commutes if and only if .   There are some special types of arrows we will want to consider.  Morphism Inverses   Let be any category.   An arrow is left invertible if there exists such that . In this case, we say that is the left inverse of . So is a left inverse of if the diagram   commutes.    An arrow is right invertible if there exists such that . In this case, we say that is the right inverse of . So is a right inverse of if the diagram   commutes.    An arrow is an isomorphism if there exists such that and . Unsurprisingly, such an arrow is called the inverse of .       Isomorphisms     In , , and the isomorphisms are the morphisms that are bijective functions.    In contrast, in the isomorphisms are the homeomorphisms, which are the bijective continuous functions with continuous inverses. These are not the same thing as just the bijective continuous functions.       Opposite Categories and Subcategories    The life of this world is nothing but the harmony of opposites.   Rumi   We will now continue to follow a familiar pattern and define the related concepts one can guess should be defined.  Subcategory   A subcategory  of a category consists of a subcollection of the objects of and a subcollection of the morphisms of such that the following hold:   For every object in , the arrow is an arrow in .    For every arrow in , its source and target in are objects in .    For every pair of arrows and in such that is an arrow that makes sense in , is an arrow in .       In particular, is a category in its own right.  Subcategories  The category of finitely generated -modules with -module homomorphisms is a subcategory of .   Subcategories of Vector Spaces  Let be a field.   The collection of finite dimensional -vector spaces with all linear transformations is a category.    The collection of all -dimensional -vector spaces with all linear transformations is a category.    The collection of all -vector spaces (or -dimensional vector spaces) with linear isomorphisms is a category.    The collection of all -vector spaces (or -dimensional vector spaces) with nonzero linear transformations is not a category, since it is not closed under composition.    The collection of all -dimensional vector spaces with linear transformations of determinant 0 is not a category, since it does not have identity maps.      Full Subcategory   A subcategory of is a full subcategory if includes all of the arrows in between any two objects in .    Full Subcategories     The category of abelian groups is a full subcategory of .    Since every group is a set, and every homomorphism is a function, is a subcategory of . However, not every function between two groups is a group homomorphism, so is not a full subcategory of .    The category whose objects are all sets and with arrows all bijections is a subcategory of that is not full.      Here is another way of constructing a new category out of an old one.  Opposite Category   Let be a category. The opposite category of , denoted , is a category whose objects are the objects of , and such that each arrow is the same as some arrow in . The composition of two morphisms and in is defined as the composition in .    Many objects and concepts one might want to describe are obtained from existing ones by flipping the arrows. Opposite categories give us the formal framework to talk about such things. We will often want to refer to dual notions, which will essentially mean considering the same notion in a category and in the opposite category ; in practice, this means we should flip all the arrows involved. We will see examples of this later on.  The dual category construction gives us a formal framework to talk about dual notions. We will often make a statement in a category and make comments about the dual statement; in practice, this corresponds to simply switching the way all arrows go. Here are some examples of dual notions and statements:     source  target    epi  mono    is a right inverse for  is a left inverse for    is invertible  is invertible    initial objects  terminal objects    homology  cohomology     Note that the dual of the dual is the original statement; we can make this more formal by saying that . Sometimes we can easily prove a statement by dualizing; however, this is not always straightforward, and one needs to carefully dualize all portions of the statement in question. Nevertheless, Sanders MacLane, one of the fathers of category theory, wrote that \"If any statement about a category is deducible from the axioms for a category, the dual statement is likely deducible\". One of the upshots of duality is that any theorem in category theory must simultaneously prove two theorems: the original statement and its dual. But for this to hold, we need proofs that use the abstraction of a purely categorical proof.  Opposite categories are more interesting than they might appear at first; there is more than just flipping all the arrows. For example, consider the opposite category of Set. For any nonempty set , there is a unique morphism in Set (a function) , but there are no functions , so is not a function. Thus thinking about Set is a bit difficult. One can show that this is the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras - but we won't concern ourselves with what that means.           "

  "body": "Functors           Functor? Damn Near Killed 'er!    If you're brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new hello.   Paulo Coelho   Many mathematical constructions are functorial, in the sense that they behave well with respect to morphisms. In the formalism of category theory, this means that we can think of a functorial construction as a functor.  Functor   Let and be categories. A covariant functor is a mapping that assigns to each object in an object in , and to each arrow an arrow , such that    preserves the composition of maps, meaning for all arrows and in , and     preserves the identity arrows, meaning for all objects in .     A contravariant functor  is a mapping that assigns to each object in an object in , and to each arrow an arrow , such that    preserves the composition of maps, meaning for all composable arrows and in , and     preserves the identity arrows, meaning for all objects in .       So a contravariant functor is a functor that flips all the arrows. We can also describe a contravariant functor as a covariant functor from to the opposite category of , .   A contravariant functor can be thought of as a covariant functor , or also as a covariant functor . If using one of these conventions, one needs to be careful, however, when composing functors, so that the respective sources and targets match up correctly. While we haven't specially discussed how one composes functors, it should be clear that applying a functor and is the same as applying a functor , which we can write as .  For example, if and are both contravariant functors, the composition is a covariant functor, since   So we could think of as a covariant functor and as a covariant functor . Similarly, if is a covariant functor and is a contravariant functor, is a contravariant functor. In this case, we can think of as a covariant functor , so that is now a covariant functor .   Functors Preserve Isomorphisms  Show that functors preserve isomorphisms.   Here are some examples of functors you may have encountered before.  Functors     Many categories one may think about are concrete categories, where the objects are sets with some extra structure, and the arrows are functions between those sets that preserved that extra structure. The forgetful functor from such a category to is the functor that, just as the name says, forgets that extra structure, and sees only the underlying sets and functions of sets. For example, the forgetful functor  sends each group to its underlying set, and each group homomorphism to the corresponding function of sets.    The identity functor  on any category does what the name suggests: it sends each object to itself and each arrow to itself.    Given a group , the subgroup of generated by the set of commutators is a normal subgroup, and the quotient is called the abelianization of . The group is abelian. Given a group homomorphism automatically takes commutators to commutators, so it induces a homomorphism . More precisely, abelianization gives a covariant functor from to .    The unit group functor  :   sends a ring to its group of units . To see this is indeed a functor, we should check it behaves well on morphisms; and indeed if is a ring homomorphism, and is a unit in , then so is a unit in . Thus induces a function given by restriction of to , which must therefore be a group homomorphism since preserves products.    Fix a field . Given a vector space , the collection of linear transformations from to is again a -vector space, the dual vector space of . If is a linear transformation and is an element of , then is in . Doing this for all elements gives a function , and one can show that is a linear transformation. The assignment that sends each vector space to its dual vector space and each linear transformation to is a contravariant functor on Vect- .    Localization is a functor. Let be a ring and be a multiplicatively closed set in . There is localization at induces a a functor  that sends each -module to , and each -module homomorphism to the -module homomorphism .       If we apply a covariant functor to a diagram, then we get a diagram of the same shape:   However, if we apply a contravariant functor to the same diagram, we get a similar diagram but with the arrows reversed:     Properties of Functors         If we think about functors as functions between categories, it's natural to consider what would be the appropriate versions of the notions of injective or surjective.    A covariant functor between locally small categories is    faithful if all the functions of sets are injective.     full if all the functions of sets are surjective.     fully faithful if it is full and faithful.     essentially surjective if every object in is isomorphic to for in .    an embedding if it is fully faithful and injective on objects.       Forgetfull Functor is Faithful  The forgetful functor   is faithful since any two maps of -modules with the same source and target coincide if and only if they are the same function of sets. This functor is not full, since there not every functions between the underlying sets of two -modules is an -module homomorphism.    A fully faithful functor is not necessarily injective on objects, but it is injective on objects up to isomorphism.    Show that every fully faithful functor reflects isos:   If is an arrow in such that is an iso, then is an iso.    If and are isomorphic, then the objects and are isomorphic in .       A subcategory of is full if the inclusion functor is full.   Full Subcategories     The category of abelian groups is a full subcategory of .    The category whose objects are all sets and with arrows all bijections is a subcategory of that is not full.       The Functors         To close this section, here are the two of the most important functors we will discuss this semester:  Functors   Let be a locally small category. An object in induces two functors:   The covariant functor Set is defined as follows:   We may refer to this functor as the covariant functor represented by . Given an arrow in , we write . It is easier to see what does through the following commutative diagram:      The contravariant functor is defined as follows:   We may refer to this functor as the contravariant functor represented by . Given an arrow in , we write . It is easier to see what does through the following commutative diagram:          Check that and are indeed functors.   We will be particularly interested in the -functors in the category , which we will study in detail in a later chapter.    Functors we will be using: Hom, tensor, homology, localization      Functors are generalizatons of functions that allow us to move between categories. They can be either covariant or contravariant.    Two extremely important functors are the functors.     "

Natalie Angier     Let and be covariant functors . A natural transformation between and is a mapping that to each object in assigns an arrow such that for all , the diagram   commutes. A natural isomorphism is a natural transformation  where each is an isomorphism. We sometimes write   or simply .  Let and be contravariant functors . A natural transformation between and is a mapping that to each object in assigns an arrow such that for all , the diagram   commutes.    Often, when studying a particular topic, we sometimes say a certain map is natural to mean that there is actually a natural transformation behind it.   Recall the abelianization functor we discussed in Example 1.26. The abelianization comes equipped with a natural projection map , the usual quotient map from to a normal subgroup. Here we mean natural in two different ways: both that this is common sense map to consider, and that this is in fact coming from a natural transformation. What's happening behind the scenes is that abelianization is a functor . On objects, the abelianizations functor is defined as . Given an arrow, meaning a group homomorphism , one can check that is contained in the kernel of , so factors through , and there exists a group homomorphism making the following diagram commute:   So the abelianization functor takes the arrow to . The commutativity of the diagram above says that is a natural transformation between the identity functor on and the abelianization functor, which we can write more compactly as    Functor Category   Let be two functors between the categories and . We write   Given two categories and , one can build a functor category  Yes, the madness is neverending. with objects all covariant functors , and arrows the corresponding natural transformations. This category is denoted . Sometimes one writes for , but we will avoid that, as it might make things even more confusing.    For the functor category to truly be a category, though, we need to know how to compose natural transformations.  Composition of Natural Transformations  Consider natural transformations   and   We can compose them for form a new natural transformation   We should think of this composition as happening vertically. For each object in sends to the arrow . This makes the diagram   commute.    Show that a natural transformation is a natural isomorphism if and only if there exists a natural transformation such that is the identity natural isomorphism on and is the identity natural isomorphism on .   Equivalent Categories   Two categories and are equivalent if there exist functors and and two natural isomorphisms and . We say that a functor is an equivalence of categories if there exists a functor and natural isomorphisms and as above.    If one assumes the Axiom of Choice, this is the right notion of isomorphism of two categories (though not in the categorical sense!); better said, two categories that are equivalent are essentially the same. Note that this does not mean that there is a bijection between the objects of and the objects of . In fact, one can show that a functor is an equivalence of categories if and only if it is fully faithful and essentially surjective - though this fact requires the Axiom of Choice!   Let be the category with one object and a unique arrow . Let be the category with two objects and and four arrows: the identities and two isomorphisms and . Let be the category with two objects and and only two arrows, and .   Show that and are equivalent categories.    Show that and are not equivalent categories.       The Yoneda Lemma    If it walks like a duck and homs like a duck, it's naturally isomorphic to a duck.   Twitter User @_julesh_   Even though this is only a short introduction to category theory, we would be remiss not to mention the , arguably the most important statement in category theory.  Yoneda Lemma   Let be a locally small category, and fix an object in . Let Set be a covariant functor. Then there is a bijection Moreover, this correspondence is natural in both and .    Let be a natural transformation in . The proof of the Yoneda Lemma is essentially the following diagram:   Our bijection will be defined by . We should first check that this makes sense: arrows in Set are just functions between sets, and so is a function of sets . Also, is a set that contains at least the element , and is some element in the set .  Given any fixed , the fact that is a natural transformation translates into the outer commutative diagram. In particular, the maps of sets and coincide, and must in particular take to the same element in . This is the commutativity of the inner diagram, with .  The commutativity of the diagram above says that is completely determined by , since for any other object in and any arrow , we necessarily have . In particular, our map is injective. Moreover, note that each choice of gives rise to a different natural transformation by setting . So our map is indeed a bijection.  We now have two naturality statements to prove. Naturality in the functor means that given a natural isomorphism , the diagram   commutes. Given a natural transformation between and , so commutativity does hold. Naturality on the object means that given an arrow , the diagram   commutes. Given a natural transformation between and , while Now notice that   Let's look back at the big commutative diagram we started our proof with: it says in particular that . So commutativity does hold, and we are done.    One can naturally (pun intended) define the notion of functor category of contravariant functors, and then prove the corresponding , which will instead use the contravariant Hom functor.  Contravariant version of the Yoneda Lemma  Let be a locally small category, and fix an object in . Let Set be a contravariant functor. Then there is a bijection    In a way, the says that to give a natural transformation between the functors and is choosing an element in .   Notice that the says in particular that the collection of all natural transformations from to is a set. This wasn't clear a priori, since the collection of objects in is not necessarily a set.    If we apply the to the case when itself is also a Hom functor, say , the says that there is a bijection between and . In particular, each arrow in determines a natural transformation between Hom functors.   One of the consequences of the is the Yoneda Embedding, which roughly says that every locally small category can be embedded into the category of contravariant functors from to Set. In particular, the Yoneda embedding says that natural transformations between representable functors correspond to arrows between the representing objects.  Yoneda Embedding   Let be a locally small category. The covariant functor   from to the category of contravariant functors Set is an embedding. Moreover, the contravariant functor   from the category to the category of covariant functors Set is also an embedding.    First, note that our functors are injective on objects because the -sets in our category are all disjoint. We need to check that given objects and in , we have bijections and   We will do the details for the first one, and leave the second as an exercise.  First, let us take a sanity check and confirm that indeed our proposed functors take arrows in to natural transformations between and . This is essentially the content of Remark 1.43, but let's carefully check the details. The applied here tells us that each natural transformation between and corresponds to an element , which we obtain by taking . As we discussed in the proof of the , we can recover from by taking the natural transformation that for each object in has given by .  We can see that different arrows give rise to different natural transformations by applying the resulting natural transformation to the identity arrow , which takes it to . Moreover, the tells us that every natural transformation between and is the image of some , as described above.    The functors that are naturally isomorphic to some Hom functor are important.    A covariant functor is representable if there exists an object in such that is naturally isomorphic to . A contravariant functor is representable if there exists an object in such that is naturally isomorphic to .     We claim that the identity functor Set Set is representable. Let 1 be a singleton set. Given any set , there is a bijection between elements and functions sending the one element in to each . Moreover, given any other set , and a function , our bijections make the following diagram commute:   This data gives a natural isomorphism between the identity functor and .    Show that the forgetful functor is representable.    Given a ring , show that the forgetful functor is representable.   A representable functor encodes a universal property of the object that represents it. For example, in Example 1.46, mapping out of the singleton set is the same as choosing an element in a set . We have all seen constructions that are at first a bit messy but that end up satisfying some nice universal property that makes everything work out. At the end of the day, a universal property allows us to ignore the messy details and focus on the universal property, which usually says everything we need to know about the construction. And as you may have already realized, universal properties are everywhere. Before we give a formal definition, we want to discuss some important examples.           "

  "title": "Maps of Complexes",
  "body": "Maps of Complexes    Definitions: category, complex     We are finally ready to introduce the category of chain complexes, and to talk more about exact sequences in homology.   Establishing    A chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain.   William James   Unsurprisingly, we can form a category of complexes, but to do that we need the right definition of maps between complexes. We also take this section as a chance to set up some definitions we will need later. One thing to keep in mind as we build our basic definitions: we also want homology to be functorial.  Chain Map   Let and be complexes. A map of complexes or a chain map , which we write as or simply , is a sequence of homomorphisms of -modules such that the following diagram commutes:   This means that for all .    Map vs. Chain Map  Note that throughout, whenever we call a function between -modules and a map , we really mean to say it is a homomorphism of -modules.   Zero and Identity Chain Maps  The zero and the identity maps of complexes are exactly what they sound like: the zero map is 0 in every homological degree, and the identity map is the identity in every homological degree.   This is the notion of morphism we would want to form a category of chain complexes.  Category of Chain Complexes   Let be a ring. The category of chain complexes of -modules, denoted or simply , is the category with objects all chain complexes of -modules and arrows all maps of complexes of -modules.     When , we write for , the category of chain complexes of abelian groups.   Note that the identity maps defined above are precisely the identity arrows in the category of chain complexes.  Understanding    Verify that is indeed a category.    Show that the isomorphisms in the category are precisely the maps of complexes   such that is an isomorphism for all .     Subcomplexes and Quotient Complexes   Given complexes and is a subcomplex of if is a submodule of for all , and the inclusion maps define a map of complexes .  Given a subcomplex of , the quotient of by is the complex that has in homological degree , with differential induced by the differential on .    Subcomplex Maps are Well-Defined  If is a subcomplex of , then the differential on satisfies . Therefore, induces a map of -modules for all , so that our definition of the differential on actually makes sense.   We can also talk about kernels and cokernels of maps of complexes.  Kernel, Cokernel   Given any map of complexes , the kernel of is the subcomplex of that we can assemble from the the kernels . More precisely, is the complex where the differentials are simply the corresponding restrictions of the differentials on .  Similarly, the image of is the subcomplex of . where the differentials are given by restriction of the corresponding differentials in . The cokernel of is the quotient complex .    Again, there are some details to check.   Show that the kernel, image, and cokernel of a complex map are indeed complexes.    The Homology Functor  This is a good notion of map of complexes: it induces homomorphisms in homology, which in particular allows us to say that homology is a functor.  Induced Homomorphisms on Homology   Let be a map of complexes. For all restricts to homomorphisms    and     .   As a consequence, induces homomorphisms on homology .     Since , any element , say , is taken to   Similarly, if , then so . Finally, the restriction of to sends into , and thus it induces a well-defined homomorphism on the quotients .    Induced Map in Homology   Let be a map of complexes. We call the map the induced map in homology , and sometimes denote it by .    Homology Functor  One can show that preserves compositions, and that moreover, the map in homology induced by the identity is the identity. Thus taking th homology is a functor which takes each map of complexes to the -module homomorphism    Quasi-Isomorphism   A map of chain complexes is a quasi-isomorphism if it induces an isomorphism in homology, meaning is an isomorphism of -modules for all . If there exists a quasi-isomorphism between two complexes and , we say that and are quasi-isomorphic , and write .     Note that saying that if is a quasi-isomorphism between and is a stronger statement that the fact that for all : it also says that there are isomorphisms that are all induced by .   Not all quasi-isomorphisms are isomorphisms, as the following example shows:   Let denote the projection map from to . The chain map   is a quasi-isomorphism.   When we look at the induced map of on homology, the only index where the induced homomorphism may not be is at . Observe however, that is the identity map, as is mapped to and is mapped to . Thus is indeed a quasi-isomorphism.    Homotopy    Transformation is not automatic. It must be learned; it must be led.   W. Edwards Deming   Homotopy   Let be maps complexes. A homotopy , sometimes referred to as a chain homotopy , between and is a sequence of maps    such that for all . If there exists a homotopy between and , we say that and are homotopic or that they have the same homotopy type . We write to say that and are homotopic. If is homotopic to the zero map, we say is nullhomotopic , and write . This should not be confused with the notation on complexes.    Homotopy is an Equivalence Relation  Homotopy is an equivalence relation.   The equivalence classes under homotopy are called homotopy classes. Homotopy is an interesting equivalence relation because homotopic maps induce the same map on homology.  Nullhomotopic Maps Induce Zero Map in Homology   Let be maps of complexes. If is homotopic to , then for all . In particular, every nullhomotopic map induces the zero map in homology.    Let be homotopic maps of complexes, and let be a homotopy between and . We claim that the map of complexes (defined in the obvious way) sends cycles to boundaries. If , then The map on homology induced by must then be the map, so and induce the same map on homology. Here we are implicitly using the fact that , which we leave as an exercise to be further explored in .     Let be maps of complexes. Show that for all .       This makes homology an additive functor , which we define explicitly in .   Notice, however, that the converse is false: the induced map in homology can be the zero map (for all homological degrees) even if the original map of complexes is not nullhomotopic.   Consider the following map of complexes:   Show that this map is not nullhomotopic, but that the induced map in homology is zero.   Suppose by way of contradiction that is nullhomotopic. Thus , where the arise from the definition of homotopy. Consider . As and , by the given equality we must have . Thus must map to either or in . However, the following shows that neither can be the case:     As and in , we have reached a contradiction. Thus, is not nullhomotopic.  However, the induced map in homology at the degree is where . As for all , we see that . As this was the only location where the homology could have been nonzero, we see that the induced map on is zero.   Homotopy Equivalent   If and are maps of complexes such that is homotopic to the identity map on and is homotopic to the identity chain map on , we say that and are homotopy equivalences and and are homotopy equivalent .    Homotopy Equvivalences are Quasi-Isomorphisms   Homotopy equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms.    If and are such that is homotopic to and is homotopic to , then by the map induces the identity map on homology. So for all we have Therefore, and must both be isomorphisms.    The converse is false.   Let denote the projection map from to . The chain map   is a quasi-isomorphism but not a homotopy equivalence.       The relation , meaning \"there is a quasi-isomorphism from to \", is not symmetric: in , there is no quasi-isomorphism going in the opposite direction of the one given.    Complexes of Complexes    Every complex problem has a simple solution that doesn't work.   H.L. Mencken   Now that we know about maps between complexes, it's time to point out that we can also talk about complexes of complexes and exact sequences of complexes. While we will later formalize this a little better when we discover that is an abelian category , let's for now give quick definitions that we can use.  Complexes in   A complex in is a sequence of complexes of -modules and chain maps between them such that for all . A complex of complexes is a diagram of the form   where is the module in homological degree in the complex . The th column corresponds to the complex , and every row is also a complex. The vertical maps are the differentials on each individual complex; the horizontal maps are the differentials on the complex of complexes.    Given a complex in , we can talk about cycles and boundaries, which are a sequence of subcomplexes of the complexes in , and thus its homology. Such a complex is exact if for all .  Short Exact Sequences in   A short exact sequence of complexes is an exact complex in of the form Equivalently, a short exact sequence of complexes is a commutative diagram   where the rows are exact and the columns are complexes.

  "body": "Split Exact Sequences        Definition and the Splitting Lemma    The split in you is clear.   John Cantwell Kiley   In this section, we will discuss short exact sequences of modules in a bit more detail. We note, however, that everything we will discuss here can be extended for short exact sequences of complexes, and that the generalization is not too difficult: one just needs to replace modules with complexes and maps of modules by maps of complexes.  Trivial Short Exact Sequences  Fix a ring , and let and be -modules. Consider the inclusion of into the first component of the direct sum, and the projection map onto the second component of the product. These two maps fit into a short exact sequence These are sometimes called trivial short exact sequences .   On the one hand, the short exact sequences that look like this one are very important; on the other hand, not all short exact sequences are of this type.  Split Short Exact Sequences   We say that a short exact sequence  splits or is a split short exact sequence if it is isomorphic to where is the inclusion of the first component and is the projection onto the second component.    Splitting Lemma   Consider the short exact sequence of -modules. The following are equivalent:   There exists a homomorphism of -modules such that .    There exists a homomorphism of -modules such that .    The short exact sequence splits.      Proof: and  First, we will show that c implies a and b. If the sequence splits, then consider an isomorphism of complexes   meaning that the diagram commutes and , and are isomorphisms of -modules, is the inclusion in the first component, and is the projection onto the second component. Let be the projection onto the first component, and be the inclusion onto the first component. Now consider the maps and . Then and Therefore, c implies a and b.   Proof:  Now suppose that a holds, and let's show that the sequence splits. First, we need to show that . Every can be written as where , and so . This shows that . Moreover, if , then , so , and . Now when we restrict to becomes injective. We claim it is also surjective, and thus an isomorphism. Indeed, for any we can pick such that , since is surjective, and we showed that we can write for some . Then Finally, note that , so we conclude that , via the isomorphism given by Since and , so , where is the inclusion on the first factor. If denotes the projection onto the second factor, . Together, these two facts say that the following is a map of complexes:   Since is an isomorphism, so is our map of complexes, and thus our original sequence is a split exact sequence. This shows that a implies .   Proof:  Now assume b holds. Every can be written as where and so . This shows that . Moreover, if , then Therefore, . Now is injective, since , and thus . Since , we conclude that , via the isomorphism Finally, let denote the inclusion of the first factor, and denote the projection onto the second factor. By construction, . Moreover, so . Together, these say that the diagram   commutes, and must then be an isomorphism of short exact sequences.    Splittings   Given a split short exact sequence maps and satisfying the conditions of the Splitting Lemma are called splittings .     In the split short exact sequence the canonical projection and the usual inclusion are splittings.    When Do Short Exact Sequences Split?         The Rank-Nulity Theorem can be recast in this setting as a consequence of the fact that every short exact sequence of -vector spaces splits.  Splittings in Vector Spaces     Let be a field. Show that every short exact sequence of -vector spaces splits.    Prove the Rank-Nulity Theorem using : show that given any linear transformation of -vector spaces,          Let be a short exact sequence of -vector spaces. Thus is injective. Let be a basis for . As is injective it maps linearly independent sets to linearly independent sets, and so , where is a linearly independent in .  As proved so deliciously in 818 (and 815), in vector spaces we can extend any linearly independent set into a basis (with some help from Zorn), and thus we extend into a basis . Using the UMP for free modules there exists a unique -vector space homomorphism such that for all , where maps to whenever .  Let and consider . As for and ,   Thus . Therefore, by the Splitting Lemma, every exact sequence of -vector spaces splits.    Let be a linear transformation. Then and are both subspaces (just in different places). Consider the sequence where is the natural inclusion and is restricted to its image. As is injective and is surjective (by definition), this sequence is exact. By part . the sequence splits. Thus , which implies that , completing the proof.      But over a general ring, not every short exact sequence splits.   The short exact sequence is not split. Indeed, does not have any 2 -torsion elements, so it is not isomorphic to .  An alternative explanation is that there is no splitting to the inclusion . On the one hand, every -module map is given by multiplication by a fixed integer , so a splitting would be of the form for some fixed . On the other hand, our proposed splitting must send to , but there is no integer solution to .   More surprisingly, a short exact sequence of the form is not necessarily split, not unless is the inclusion of the first component and is the projection onto the second component, as the next example will show.   Consider the short exact sequence where is the inclusion of the subgroup generated by 2, so , and is the quotient onto that subgroup, meaning . This is not a split short exact sequence, because . Now let be the direct sum of infinitely many copies of . Then and the sequence with and is still exact. The middle term is indeed isomorphic to the direct sum of the other two: And yet this is not a split exact sequence: if we had a splitting of , then its restriction to the first factor would give us a splitting of , which we know cannot exist, since does not split.   Given splittings and for a short exact sequence as in , we can quickly show that our short exact sequence splits using the Five Lemma. To prove the Five Lemma, one needs to use diagram chasing. Diagram chasing is a common technique in homological algebra, which essentially consists of tracing elements around in the diagram. We will see some examples of diagram chasing in the next section.  The Five Lemma  Consider the following commutative diagram of -modules with exact rows:   Show that if , and are isomorphisms, then is an isomorphism.    Given a short exact sequence, suppose we have -module homomorphisms and    such that and . Then we get an induced map such that the diagram   commutes. The guarantees that must be an isomorphism, so our diagram is an isomorphism of short exact sequences.   There are many ways in which -Mod behaves better than the category of groups, and this is one of them.   The does not hold if we replace -modules with the category of groups. For example, consider the symmetric group on 3 elements and the inclusion of the alternating group in . Notice that is precisely the kernel of the sign map which sends even permutations to and odd permutations to . Therefore, is a short exact sequence. When writing exact sequences of nonabelian groups such as this one, one sometimes uses for instead of , to indicate that trivial group. So our short exact sequence is   Moreover, this exact sequence is not split, since is not abelian but is, and thus . However, any group homomorphism defined by sending the generator to any two cycle is a splitting for our short exact sequence, meaning signo .  Funny enough, there is no splitting for the inclusion , since there are no nontrivial homomorphisms has no elements of order , so a group homomorphism must send every -cycle in must be sent to the identity, but -cycles generate .   We will return to the topic of split short exact sequences when we talk about projective and injective modules.   Fix a ring . Show that if is a free -module, then every short exact sequence of -modules splits.            "

  "title": "Long Exact Sequences",
  "body": "Long Exact Sequences        The Snake Lemma         A long exact sequence is just what it sounds like: an exact sequence that is, well, long. Usually, we use the term long exact sequence to refer to any exact sequence, especially if it is not a short exact sequence. So in particular, a long exact sequence does not literally have to be that long.  Long exact sequences arise naturally in various ways, and are often induced by some short exact sequence. The first long exact sequence one encounters is the long exact sequence on homology. All other long exact sequences are, in some way, a special case of this one. The main tool we need to build it is the Snake Lemma.  Snake Lemma   Consider the commutative diagram of -modules   If the rows of the diagram are exact, then there exists an exact sequence Given , pick such that , and such that . Then The picture to keep in mind (and which explains the name of the lemma) is the following:     If , then by commutativity, so . Similarly, if then . So   We claim that the sequence obtained by restriction is exact. On the one hand, we already know that the original maps satisfy , so their restrictions must satisfy this as well, guaranteeing that On the other and, if is such that , then by exactness of the original sequence there exists such that ; we only need to check that we can choose such satisfying . An indeed, by commutativity, any with satisfies and since is injective, we must have . So we have shown that the following is an exact sequence:   Similarly, if , the commutativity of the diagram guarantees that , and if , then . So the maps restrict to maps which then induce maps To make the notation less heavy, we denote the induced maps on the quotients by and . Again, the fact that automatically gives us that the restrictions satisfy so we only need to check equality. Consider such that , meaning that , meaning that . Let be such that . Since is surjective, there exists such that , and by commutativity, Then . Let be such that . Now in coker we have This concludes the proof of exactness of and coker .  We still need to show the parts of the statement related to the connecting homomorphism . Our definition of can be visualized as follows:   Let's recap the process in words. First, we fix . Since is surjective, we can always pick such that . Since ker , by commutativity we have so . Therefore, there exists such that . In fact, since is injective, there exists a unique such that . Our definition of sets The fact that is a homomorphism of -modules follows from the fact that all the maps involved are homomorphisms of -modules: given , and such that we have So Therefore, . Similarly, given any , and , so . We now need to show the following:   Points 2) and 3) together say that the sequence is exact, and this will complete the proof.  First, let's show that is well-defined. Ultimately, our definition of only involves one choice, when we pick such that ; we need to show that does not depend on the choice of . Given such that , by exactness we have . Therefore, there exists such that . Notice that is such that Thus our definition says that . Since , we conclude that , so for any choice of . Now consider any . Again, to show is well-defined, we need only to show it does not depend on the choice of such that . Consider such that and such that Note that and since we must have Thus and this concludes our proof that is well-defined.  Now we show 2): that .  If , then the only such that is . Therefore, , so . On the other hand, let be such that . That means that for any such that we must have for some . Let be such that . Then     so . Since ,     We conclude that , and this shows 2 .  Now we show 3 ), that is, .  Let be such that . In , this says that , so we can choose such that . Using commutativity and the fact that , we have     This shows that , and thus . Finally, if and , then       Connecting Homomorphism   The map in the is the connecting homomorphism .    The proof of the is what we call a diagram chase, for reasons that may be obvious by now: we followed the diagram in the natural way, and everything worked out in the end. The is another classical example of a diagram chase.   The Long Exact Sequence in Homology         Now that we have the , we can construct the long exact sequence in homology:  Long Exact Sequence in Homology   Given a short exact sequence in  there are connecting homomorphisms such that is an exact sequence.    For each , we have short exact sequences   The condition that and are maps of complexes implies, by , that and take cycles to cycles, so we get exact sequences Again by , the condition that and are maps of complexes also implies that and both take boundaries to boundaries, so that we get exact sequences   Let be any complex. The boundary maps on induce maps that send to , so we get induced maps . Applying this general fact to , and , and putting all this together, we have a commutative diagram with exact rows   For any complex , and   The now gives us exact sequences   Finally, we glue all these together to obtain the long exact sequence in homology.     It's helpful to carefully consider how to compute the connecting homomorphisms in the long exact sequence in homology, which we can easily put together from the proof of the . Suppose that . When we view as an element in , we can find such that , since is surjective by assumption. Since is a map of complexes, we have so . In fact, note that , so   Thus there exists such that . Finally,   So in summary, the recipe goes as follows: given , we find such that and such that , and    We will soon see that long exact sequences appear everywhere, and that they are very helpful. Before we see more examples, we want to highlight a connection between long and short exact sequences.   Suppose that is a long exact sequence. This long exact sequence breaks into the short exact sequences   The first map is simply the inclusion of the submodule into , while the second map is the canonical projection onto the quotient. While it is clear that is injective and is surjective, exactness at the middle is less obvious. This follows from the exactness of the original complex, which gives .   The long exact sequence in homology is natural.  Naturality of the long exact sequence in homology   Any commutative diagram in    with exact rows induces a commutative diagram with exact rows     The rows of the resulting diagram are the long exact sequences in homology induced by each row of the original diagram, as in . So the content of the theorem is that the maps induced in homology by , and make the diagram commute. The commutativity of   follows from the fact that is a functor, so we only need to check commutativity of the square   that involves the connecting homomorphisms and . Consider the following commutative diagram:   Given , we need to check that in . To compute , we find a lift such that , and with , and set . So . On the other hand, to compute , we start by finding such that . By commutativity of the right back square   we can choose , since   Next we take such that , and set . By commutativity of the middle square   we have   By our choice of , we have and by commutativity of the front left square   we have   So we can take . Finally, this means , as we wanted to prove.     Let be a short exact sequence in .

  "body": "       There's No Place Like    We shape our s and then our s shape us.   Winston Churchill   From now on, let's fix a ring . Recall that whenever we say an -module , we mean a left -module; any general facts about left modules can be naturally converted into statements about right -modules, under small appropriate corrections. When is commutative, left and right module structures agree, so the distinction is not relevant.  Our goal is to get to know the category -Mod, which as we are about to discover is a very nice category. One of the many nice things about -Mod is that the -sets have an extra structure. (Roughly speaking, a locally small category where the -sets are objects in some other category is called an enriched category).  To make the notation less heavy, we write instead of for the -set between and in -Mod. The arrows in are all the -module homomorphisms from to . This is a locally small category, meaning that the -sets are actual sets, but more even is true: the -sets are actually abelian groups, and when is commutative, they are even -modules.  Given is the -module homomorphism defined by When is a commutative ring, given and is the -module homomorphism defined by      Let and be -modules. Then is an abelian group under the sum defined above.    Let and be -modules over a commutative . Then is an -module.    The main reason we need commutativity for to be a module is that given any and , we need to be an -module homomorphism, so in particular for any and any we need So This holds whenever , but not in general.   Some -sets can easily be identified with other well-understood modules.   Let be a commutative ring. Let be an -module, and an ideal in . Then we have the following isomorphisms of -modules:    .     for any .     .       Additive Functors    To split yourself in two is just about the most radical thing you can do.   Ani DiFranco   Since -Mod is a locally small category, we saw in Definition 1.34 that there are two -functors from -Mod to , the covariant functor -Mod Set and the contravariant functor -Mod Set. In light of , we can upgrade these functors to land in , or in -Mod when is commutative, not just in . Note that while there are two -functors, we will sometimes refer to the Hom functor when talking about properties that are common to both of them.  A functor that lands in , or in particular, can have some additional good properties.  Additive Functor   Let and be rings. A functor -Mod -Mod is an additive functor if for all .    Note that to say that is a covariant additive functor is to say that for all and , the map induced by is a homomorphism of abelian groups. Similarly, a contravariant additive functor is one such that is a homomorphism of abelian groups. Notice moreover that this definition makes sense more generally in any category whose objects have an abelian group structure.  is Additive  Show that and are both additive functors.   Note that in we were purposely vague about where and land: these are additive functors whether we consider them as functors with target or target -Mod, when appropriate.  Additive functors have many nice properties.  Properties of Additive Functors   Let Mod -Mod be an additive functor.   Let denote the -map between any two -modules and . Then is the .    Let denote the zero -module. Then is the zero -module.          As a function defined on each fixed is a group homomorphism, so it must send to .    An -module is the zero module if and only if the zero and identity maps on coincide. Let be the image of the zero -module via . On the one hand, any functor must send identity maps to identity maps, so the identity map on the zero module must be sent to the identity on . On the other hand, we have shown that the zero map must be sent to the zero map on , so the zero and identity maps on must coincide, so .        Note that the category of chain complexes also has a similar structure to -Mod: given two maps of complexes , we define a map of complexes : given by It is routine to check that this again gives a map of complexes, and that this operation gives the -sets in the structure of an abelian group. In fact, this abelian group structure can be upgraded to an -module structure when is commutative, by setting for all . This allows us to talk about additive functors to and from the category , and there is a version of in .   Homology is Additive  Show that homology is an additive functor.   Most functors between categories or modules or chain complexes are additive. In fact, we will spend the rest of this chapter studying three very important additive functors: the two functors, and a third functor we have yet to define.  Additive Functors Preserve Direct Sums  Let and be rings and let -Mod -Mod be an additive functor. Show that for all -modules and ,     satisfies a stronger version of this property.    For all -modules , there are isomorphisms of abelian groups Moreover, when is commutative, these are in fact isomorphisms of -modules.  In particular, and     For each , let be the canonical projection map. Consider the map We claim this map is the desired isomorphism. We leave it as an exercise to show that is a homomorphism of abelian groups, and a homomorphism of -modules when is commutative; we focus on proving that is a bijection. First, take . Define a map This makes the diagram   commute, so that . This shows that us surjective. Now let us show that is injective. Suppose is such that . For each , let , so . By assumption, , which means that for all , and thus for all . So . We conclude that is an isomorphism.  Now consider the map where is the inclusion of the th factor. We leave it as an exercise to prove that is a homomorphism of abelian groups, and that whenever is commutative, is in fact a homomorphism of -modules.  Given , let   Then , so for each and each , and . This shows that is surjective.  Now assume , which implies that is the zero map for each . Consider any . For each . On the other hand, , so . We conclude that , and is injective.    These two properties, however, are consequences of and : is additive, and additive functors preserve finite direct sums.   Show that the isomorphisms in are natural on both components. More precisely, given any other family of -modules such that for each there exists , a map there exist -module maps making the following diagrams commute:   In fact, one can show that more generally, behaves well with limits and colimits.    Let be any ring and consider -modules and .   For any inverse system , there is a natural isomorphism     For any direct system or -modules, there is a natural isomorphism    Moreover, when is commutative, these are isomorphisms of modules.    Exact Functors    My biggest problem is retaining the exact information.   David Cross   Another important property of is how it interacts with exact sequences. First, an important note about general additive functors:   Let -Mod -Mod be an additive functor. Thanks to , if , then Thus must send complexes to complexes, and in fact, induces a functor , which we also call . Now if is a homotopy between two maps of complexes, must preserve the identities for all , so is a homotopy between and .   While additive functors send complexes to complexes, they don't have to preserve exactness. Functors that do preserve exactness are very special.  Exact Functors   An additive functor -Mod -Mod is an exact functor if it preserves short exact sequences. When is covariant, this means that every short exact sequence is taken to the short exact sequence   When is contravariant, this means that any short exact sequence is taken to the short exact sequence     Functors are Exact iff They Commute with Homology  Show that an additive functor is exact if it commutes with homology, that is, for all complexes and all ,    As we will soon see, most functors are not exact. However, many functors of interest preserve some exactness.  Left and Right Exact Functors   A covariant additive functor -Mod -Mod is left exact if it takes every exact sequence of -modules to the exact sequence of -modules, and right exact if it takes every exact sequence of -modules to the exact sequence of -modules     Left and Right Exact Functors   A contravariant additive functor -Mod -Mod is left exact if it takes every exact sequence of -modules to the exact sequence of -modules, and right exact if it takes every exact sequence of -modules to the exact sequence of -modules     Exactness and SESs  The definitions above all stay unchanged if for each condition we start with a short exact sequence. For example, a covariant additive functor is left exact if and only if for every short exact sequence of -modules, is exact.    Left exact covariant functors take kernels to kernels, while right exact covariant functors take cokernels to cokernels: the kernel of fits in an exact sequence and applying a left exact functor gives us an exact sequence Exactness tells us that is the kernel of .  Similarly, the cokernel of fits into an exact sequence which any right exact functor will take to an exact sequence Exactness says that is the cokernel of .  Similarly, left exact contravariant functors take cokernels to kernels, and right exact contravariant functors take kernels to cokernels. A left exact contravariant functor will take the exact sequence to an exact sequence and exactness tells us that is the kernel of .  A right exact contravariant functor will take the exact sequence to the exact sequence and exactness says that is the cokernel of .   Exactness is preserved by natural isomorphisms.   Suppose that -Mod -Mod are naturally isomorphic additive functors. We claim that is exact if and only if is exact. Let's prove it in the case when and are covariant. Given any short exact sequence applying each of our functors yields complexes of -modules which may or may not be exact. Our natural isomorphism gives us an isomorphism of complexes   Isomorphisms of complexes induce isomorphisms in homology, so the top sequence is exact if and only if the bottom sequence is exact. Thus preserves the short exact sequence if and only if does.  A similar argument shows that is left (respectively, right) exact if and only if is left (respectively, right) exact; we leave the details as an exercise.   However, an additive functor does not have to be left exact nor right exact. There are even some functors that preserve exactness in the middle.  Homology is Exact in the Middle  The homology functor is exact in the middle: given a short exact sequence the exactness of the long exact sequence in homology says in particular that is exact for all . On the other hand, we claim that the homology functor is neither left exact nor right exact. More precisely, might fail to be injective and might fail to be surjective. Finding a counterexample amounts to finding a short exact sequence of complexes such that the connecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence in homology is not the zero map.  For example, consider the following complexes and maps of complexes:   Applying gives us which is not injective, so is not exact. Similarly, applying gives which is not surjective, so is not exact. Thus homology is neither left exact nor right exact, though it is exact in the middle.   But in general, an additive functor might fail to preserve exactness even in the middle.   Fix a prime and consider the functor which on objects is defined by given a homomorphism of abelian groups , we get an induced homomorphism of abelian groups and is postcomposition with . Consider the short exact sequence where is the multiplication by map, which sends , and is the canonical quotient map by the subgroup generated by .  Note that is the submodule of of elements killed by , which is generated by the class of , so . Moreover, so is the the submodule of of elements killed by , which is generated by and isomorphic to , so . Now is the map induced by multiplication by , so it is the zero map. The map is the canonical quotient by the subgroup generated by ; any element in corresponds to choosing an element of order , and thus in the subgroup generated by , so applying always results in . We conclude that . Finally, this shows that applying to the original short exact sequence gives us the complex which is not exact anywhere.   One amazing fact, however, is that even if a functor is not exact, it must always preserve split short exact sequences.  Additive Functors Preserve Split Exact Sequences  Show that additive functors preserve split short exact sequences.    is Left Exact    One should always aim at being interesting, rather than exact.   Voltaire   We are now ready for our first important example of a left exact functor: is left exact.  is Left Exact   Let be an R-module.   The covariant functor is left exact: for every exact sequence of -modules, the sequence is exact.    The contravariant functor is left exact: for every exact sequence of -modules, the sequence is exact.       To make the notation less heavy, we will write and similarly   Since additive functors send complexes to complexes, as outlined in , we at least know that and are functors, so in particular and      We have two things to show:   Suppose that is such that . By definition, this means that . But is injective, so for any  We conclude that , and is injective.    Let be in the kernel of . Then , so for each , . Then , so there exists such that . Since is injective, this element is unique for each . So setting gives us a well-defined function .  We claim that is in fact an -module homomorphism. To see that, notice that if and , then so that .  Similarly, given any , so . Finally, this element satisfies for all , so and .       Again, we have two things to show:  is injective:  If for some , then . Consider any . Since is surjective, there exists such that . Then , so .    Let be in , so that . Given any , there exists such that , since is surjective. Let be the function defined by for some with . This function is well-defined, since whenever , say , and thus . Moreover, we claim that is indeed a homomorphism of -modules. If , and , then , so   Finally, this element is such that satisfies for all , so , and .        So preserves kernels, and sends cokernels to kernels.    However, is not right exact in general.   Consider the short exact sequence of abelian groups where the first map is the inclusion of into , and the second map is the canonical projection. The elements in the abelian group are cosets of the form , where , and whenever . While says that is exact, we claim that this cannot be extended to a short exact sequence, since the map is not surjective. On the one hand, there are no nontrivial homomorphisms from to either nor , since there are no elements in nor of order . This shows that   On the other hand, is nonzero: to give a homomorphism of abelian groups is to choose an element in of order . Since is an element of order 2 in , the map sending in to in is nonzero. So after applying , we get the exact sequence So this shows that is not an exact functor, only left exact.   Similarly, we can show that is not exact:   Let's apply to the short exact sequence This time, says that is exact. We claim that the last map is not surjective. First, we claim that . Indeed, if is a homomorphism of abelian groups, then for all we have So is an integer that is divisible by every integer, which is impossible unless . We conclude that , and thus . So our exact sequence above is actually By , , so the last map in our sequence can't possibly be surjective, so our sequence is not a short exact sequence.  The other fun consequence is that and we have an exact sequence we can now conclude that    The last observation is a common trick: once we know we have an exact sequence involving certain modules we do not know, we can sometimes calculate them exactly by studying the other modules and maps in the exact sequence.  We can use the left exactness of Hom to compute some modules of interest:   Let be a commutative ring and be a finitely presented -module. This means that has a presentation with finitely many generators and relations, which translates into an exact sequence of the form   Since and are free modules, we can think of the map as multiplication by a matrix with rows and columns, after we fix a basis for and . Applying to the exact sequence above, we get an exact sequence By , and . Moreover, we claim that is multiplication by the transpose of .  First, note that given a basis for , we get a dual basis for , where   Similarly, we have a dual basis for ; we might as well assume that we picked the canonical basis in both cases, so that we can use similar notation on both.  Now the map is also given by multiplication by a matrix, now having rows and columns. To calculate its column, we need to calculate , which is given by precomposition with , so ; this reads off the th row of . Thus is indeed multiplication by , and we have an exact sequence   In particular, we have shown that is the kernel of multiplication by .            "

Fix a ring , and consider:    a right -module ,    a left -module ,    an abelian group .    A function is -biadditive if for all , all , and all we have               .    When is a commutative ring, suppose that is also an -module. We say that a function is -bilinear if for all , all , and all we have               .      Note that an -bilinear function is an -biadditive function that satisfies      Example 3.19. The product on is an -biadditive function . The first two rules follow from distributivity of multiplication over the sum; the final rule is a consequence of the associativity of multiplication.  When is commutative, this is an -bilinear function.     Definition 3.20. Let be a right -module and let be a left -module. The tensor product of and is an abelian group together with an -biadditive function with the following universal property: for every abelian group and every -biadditive map , there exists a unique group homomorphism such that the following diagram commutes:     We will now show that tensor products exist and are unique up to isomorphism; in particular, we can talk about the tensor product of and .    Lemma 3.21. Let be any ring, be a right -module, and a left -module. The tensor product of and is unique up to unique isomorphism. More precisely, if and are two tensor products, then there exists a unique isomorphism such that     Proof. First, note that the universal property of the tensor product implies that there exists a unique such that   commutes. Since the identity map is such a map, it must be the only such map.  Similarly, there are unique maps and such that   both commute. Stacking these up, we get commutative diagrams   Note that the identity maps on and are homomorphisms and that would make each of these triangles commute:   By uniqueness, must be the identity on and must be the identity on . In particular, and are isomorphic, and the isomorphisms and are unique.      Theorem 3.22. Given any right -modules and any left -module , their tensor product exists, and it is given by the abelian group defined as follows:    Generators: For each pair of elements and , we have a generator .    Relations: the generators of satisfy the following relations, where , , and :         Proof. Let be the free abelian group on the set . In what follows, we identify a pair with the corresponding basis element for . Let be the subgroup of generated by     Let , and let denote the class of in the quotient. We claim that this abelian group is a tensor product for and , together with the map     Notice is the restriction of the quotient map to the basis elements of . Moreover, by construction of , the following identities hold:     Together, these make an -biadditive map. The map that sends each pair to the corresponding basis element is -bilinear by construction. Moreover, there is a natural quotient map , and these maps make the diagram   commute.  Now suppose that is any other abelian group, and let by any -biadditive map. Since is the free -module on induces a homomorphism of abelian groups such that , meaning for all and all .  Finally, the fact that is bilinear implies that . Therefore, induces a group homomorphism on . All this fits in the following commutative diagram:   Finally, this map we constructed satisfies , and since is generated by such elements, is completely determined by the images of , and thus unique.    The construction in Theorem 3.22 gives us generators for . These are usually called simple tensors. So any element in is of the form     Such expressions are not unique. For a cheap example, consider the relations we used to construct from the abelian group on , which gives us nontrivial ways to write the 0 element in :     This makes things unexpectedly tricky. For starters, the tensor product of two nonzero modules might be zero nevertheless. Also, whenever we try to define some -module homomorphism from into some other -module, we must carefully check that our map is well-defined, which is in principle not an easy task. Therefore, the easiest way to define some -module homomorphism from is to give some -bilinear map from into our desired -module.  In summary: the tensor product of and is generated by the simple tensors , but it's important to remember (though we're all bound to forget once or twice) that not all elements in are simple tensors. Moreover, even if and are nonzero, could very well be zero.   Remark 3.23. Two group homomorphisms coincide if and only if they agree on simple tensors, since these are generators for .    Remark 3.24. In any tensor product , the simple tensor is the zero element, and     for all and .    Elements in Tensor Products    In the beginning God said, the four-dimensional divergence of an antisymmetric, second rank tensor equals zero, and there was light, and it was good. And on the seventh day he rested.   Michio Kaku   Let's see some examples of how tensor products can be zero.   Example 3.25. We claim that , despite the fact that both of these -modules are nonzero. To see that, simply note that given any and any ,     Since is generated by simple tensors, which are all 0 , we conclude that .    Example 3.26. Consider the abelian group . Again, this is very much nonzero, and yet we claim that . For any simple tensor,       Example 3.27. Let and be distinct prime integers. Then has inverse modulo , say , and has an inverse modulo , say . Given any simple tensor in      Since all simple tensors are 0 and is generated by simple tensors, we conclude that .   More generally, the following holds:   Show that if , then .   Of course not all tensor products are zero. A good method for showing that a particular element in a module is nonzero is to give a homomorphism from sending to some nonzero element. We apply this technique to tensor products: to show that a particular element in is nonzero, we construct a homomorphism from that takes no some nonzero element. This is typically easier for simple tensors: we need an -biadditive map out of that sends the corresponding pair to a nonzero element.   Example 3.28. Consider the abelian group . The map     is -bilinear, and thus it induces a homomorphism . Via this map, , so is nonzero in , and .   Moreover, not all elements in a tensor product are simple tensors.   Let and consider the ideal . Show that in , the element is not a simple tensor.    Bimodules and When Tensor Products are Modules    Envy, like a false mirror, distorts the symmetry of the sweetest form.   Norm Macdonald   We can sometimes give the structure of an -module.   Remark 3.29. Let be a commutative ring, and let and be -modules. We can give the structure of an -module, as follows: given and a simple tensor ,     We can then extend this linearly to all other elements of . We leave it as an exercise to check that this does indeed make the abelian group into an -module.   Alternatively, over a commutative ring we can define the tensor product as follows:    Definition 3.30. Let be a commutative ring and and be -modules. The tensor product of and is an -module together with an -bilinear map  with the following universal property: for every -module and every -bilinear map there exists a unique -module homomorphism such that the following diagram commutes:     One can now check that if we take the abelian group , which is the unique abelian group which satisfies the universal property of the tensor product (as defined for a general ring ), and endow it with the -module structure defined in Remark 3.29, the resulting -module satisfies the universal property in Definition 3.30, and the argument we gave in Lemma 3.21 can be repurposed to show that this is the unique -module satisfying this universal property.   Remark 3.31. We can express the universal property of the tensor product in the framework of Definition 1.87. For simplicity, assume that is a commutative ring. Consider the functor -Mod Set that sends an -module to the set of -bilinear maps , and a map of -modules to the function of sets induced by post-composition of functions. The universal property of the tensor product is encoded in the representable functor -Mod Set together with the bilinear map . Indeed, this says that induces a natural isomorphism between and by sending each -module to the bijection     The fact that this is a bijection says that for every -bilinear map there exists a unique -module homomorphism such that   commutes. So this is indeed the universal property we described before.   More generally, has a module structure when one of or is a bimodule.    Definition 3.32. Fix rings and . An -bimodule is an abelian group together with a left -module structure and a right -module structure such that for all , and ,     One sometimes writes to indicate is an -bimodule. An -bimodule is an -bimodule.     Example 3.33.  a) Let denote the ring of matrices with entries in a ring . We can also view as an -bimodule via left and right multiplication of matrices.  b) Any two-sided ideal of a ring is an -bimodule.  c) Let be a commutative ring and let be any left -module. Then is also a right -module under the same module structure, by setting     Moreover, is also an -bimodule using both of these structures at once.  d) Let be a ring homomorphism. We can view as an -bimodule via     for and , where the right hand side is just multiplication in . Similarly, can be viewed as an -bimodule and as an -bimodule.  e) Let be a commutative ring of prime characteristic , meaning that contains a copy of , or equivalently, that     Then is an -bimodule with the left module structure given by the Frobenius map     and right module structure given by the usual multiplication on . More precisely, given ,     where the right hand side is just multiplication in .    Let be an -bimodule and a left -module. Consider as a left -module via     Then is a left -module via     The map     is left -linear, and for any left -module and left -linear -biadditive map , there is a unique left -linear map such that .  Similarly, for a left -module and an -bimodule is a right -module via     Then is a right -module via     and the map     is right -linear, and for any -module and right -linear -biadditive map , there is a unique right -linear map such that .    The Tensor Product Functor         We can also take tensor products of maps.    Lemma 3.34. Let be a ring, be a homomorphism of right -modules, and be a homomorphism of left -modules. There exists a unique homomorphism of abelian groups such that     for all and . When is commutative, this map is a homomorphism of -modules. Moreover, if and are -bimodules and is left -linear, then is also a homomorphism of left -modules, and if and are -bimodules and is right -linear, then is also a homomorphism of right -modules.    Proof sketch. The function     is -biadditive, and -bilinear when is commutative, and right or left -linear in the bimodule case, so the universal property of tensor products in each case gives the desired homomorphism and its uniqueness.      Lemma 3.35. Given -module maps and , the composition of satisfies         Proof. It's sufficient to check that these maps agree on simple tensors, and indeed they both take to .   We are particularly interested in tensor products because of the tensor functor.    Theorem 3.36. Let be a right -module. There is an additive covariant functor     that takes each -module to , and each -module homomorphism to the homomorphism of abelian groups .  When is commutative, we can view as an additive functor -Mod.    Proof. Let . First, note that preserves identities, meaning , since the identity map on agrees with on simple tensors. Moreover, preserves compositions, since by Lemma 3.35 we have     Therefore, is a functor. To check that it is an additive functor, we need to prove that for all . It is sufficient to check that the maps and agree on simple tensors. Indeed,     We conclude that .      Definition 3.37. Given a ring and a right -module , the functor is the tensor product functor.    Note that we were purposely vague on the target of the tensor product functor: when is commutative, we get both a functor -Mod and a functor -Mod -Mod. The two functors are essentially the same: the tensor product functor is the composition of functor -Mod -Mod followed by the forgetful functor -Mod .  We can similarly define the tensor product functor ; when is commutative, it turns out that the two constructions are essentially the same.    Lemma 3.38 (Commutativity of tensor products). Let be a commutative ring. There is a natural isomorphism . In particular, for all -modules and we have       Proof. One can check (exercise!) that the map given by is -biadditive, and -bilinear if is commutative. The universal property of the tensor product gives us a homomorphism of abelian groups or -modules, depending on the case, such that the diagram   commutes. Similarly, we get a map and a commutative diagram   Then agrees with the identity on on simple tensors, so it is the identity. Similarly, is the identity on , and these are the desired isomorphisms.  The statement about naturality is more precisely the following: for every -module maps and , our isomorphisms and make the diagram   commute. To check this, it's sufficient to check commutativity on simple tensors, and indeed       Lemma 3.39 (Associativity of tensors). Given a right -module , an -bimodule , and a left -module ,       Proof. Fix . The map     is -biadditive, so it induces a homomorphism of abelian groups     This map is in fact a homomorphism of -modules when is commutative. Moreover,     is also -biadditive, and it induces a homomorphism that sends to . Similarly, we can define a homomorphism     The composition of these two homomorphisms in either order is the identity on simple tensors, and thus they are both isomorphisms.      Lemma 3.40. Let be any ring. There is a natural isomorphism between and the identity functor on -Mod. In particular, for every left -module there is an isomorphism of -modules       Proof. First, note that is an -bimodule, so is a left -module. The map     is -biadditive (by the distributive laws), -bilinear (by associativity of the action on a module), and -linear, so it induces a homomorphism of -modules . By definition, is surjective. Moreover, the map     is a homomorphism of -modules, since     For every , and for every simple tensor, . This shows that is an isomorphism.  Finally, given any , since is -linear we conclude that the diagram   commutes, so our isomorphism is natural.    Similarly to the Hom functor, tensor behaves well with respect to arbitrary direct sums.    Theorem 3.41. Let be a right -module, and let be an arbitrary family of left -modules. Then the map     is an isomorphism of abelian groups in general, of -modules in the commutative case, of modules if each is an -bimodule, and of right -modules if is an -bimodule. Moreover, this isomorphism is natural: given two families of left -modules and , and left -module homomorphisms , the -module homomorphisms     give a commutative diagram       Proof. First, note that the function     is -bilinear, so it induces a homomorphism     For each , let denote the inclusion map . The universal property of the coproduct (which in the case of -modules, means the direct sum) gives an -module homomorphism     which we obtain by assembling the -module homomorphisms . It is routine to check that is the inverse of , which must then be an isomorphism. Finally, we can check naturality by checking commutativity of the square above, element by element:      Remark 3.42. By commutativity of the tensor product, we also get natural isomorphisms      The following follows as a corollary of Lemma 3.40 and Theorem 3.41:   Show that if and are free -modules on bases and , respectively, then is the free -module on basis     In particular,       Example 3.43. Let be any ring and consider . Let and . We claim that the element is not a simple tensor. Suppose, by contradiction, that there exist such that     Since is a basis for the free module , we can write     Substituting above, we see that     But by Exercise 50, is a basis for the free -module , so we can now compare coefficients: since     we must have     But since is a unit and , we must have ; similarly, since is a unit and , we must have . But we have both and that are units, which is a contradiction. We conclude that is not a simple tensor.   One of the reasons tensor products are useful is that we can use tensor products to extend module structures to ring extensions.   Remark 3.44. Let be a ring homomorphism. Since is an -bimodule, the abelian group has a left -module structure for every left -module . Thus - determines a functor from -modules to -modules.     Definition 3.45. Let be a ring homomorphism. The extension of scalars from to is the functor -Mod -mod: for each -module , we get an -module with     and for each -module homomorphism we get the -module homomorphism .    This functor is closely related to restriction of scalars: we will soon show that restriction and extension of scalars are adjoint functors.    Definition 3.46. Let be a ring homomorphism. The restriction of scalars functor from to is the functor -mod -Mod that takes each -module to the -module with underlying abelian group and -module structure     induced by . Moreover, for each -module homomorphism we get the module homomorphism defined by .     Check that restriction of scalars as defined above is indeed a functor.    Tensor is Right Exact         Tensor is right exact.    Theorem 3.47. Let be a right -module. The functor is right exact, meaning that for every exact sequence     the sequence     is exact.    Proof. Since additive functors send complexes to complexes, . We have two more things to show:   we can find such that . Therefore,   .   : Let . We have already shown that , so . Let be the canonical projection. By definition, .  Consider the map     where is such that . First, we should check this map is well-defined. To see that, suppose that is another element with , so that . Then , so . Therefore, modulo , and is well-defined.  Moreover, one can check (exercise!) that is -biadditive, so it induces a homomorphism of -modules , which we will denote by . We will show that is a left inverse of , so is injective. And indeed, given and , we have     We conclude that is injective, and thus       However, tensor is not exact.   Example 3.48. Consider the short exact sequence     Applying the functor , we get an exact sequence     However, we claim that is not injective. On the one hand, by Lemma 3.40 we have an isomorphism . On the other hand, we have seen in Example 3.25 that , so the map cannot possibly be injective.   We can now show that extension of scalars turns an -module into the -module with the same presentation.   Remark 3.49. Let be a ring, be a right -module, and be a left -module. We can compute by taking a presentation of      and tensoring with to get     so is the cokernel of the map induced by . We can also compute by taking a presentation of      and tensoring with to get     so is isomorphic to the cokernel of the map induced by .            "

The three most important classes of multiplicatively closed sets are the following:   Example 3.50. Let be a commutative ring.     For any , the set is a multiplicatively closed set.    If is a prime ideal, the set is multiplicatively closed: this is an immediate translation of the definition.    An element that is not a zerodivisor is called a nonzerodivisor or regular element. The set of regular elements in forms a multiplicatively closed subset. When is a domain, this set is precisely the set of all nonzero elements .       Definition 3.51 (Localization of a ring). Let be a commutative ring, and be a multiplicative set with . The localization of at is a ring, denoted by or , given by where is the equivalence relation     The operations are given by     The zero in is and the multiplcative identity is .

The localization of at is the -module or given by     where is the equivalence relation if for some . The operations are given by     The zero in the module is given by .    Here are the most important examples of localizations you will come across in commutative algebra.   Example 3.52 (Most important localizations). Let be a commutative ring.    For and , we usually write for .    When is the set of nonzerodivisors on , we call the total ring of fractions of . When is a domain, this is just the fraction field of , and in this case this coincides with the localization at the prime , as described below.    For a prime ideal in , we generally write for , and call it the localization of at . Given an ideal in , we sometimes write to refer to , the image of via the canonical map . Notice that when we localize at a prime , the resulting ring is a local ring . We can think of the process of localization at as zooming in at the prime . Many properties of an ideal can be checked locally, by checking them for for each prime .      Remark 3.53. If is a domain, the equivalence relation defining the localization simplifies to . In particular, is a localization of .   If is not a domain, the canonical map is not necessarily injective.   Example 3.54. Consider . The canonical maps and are not injective, since in both cases is invertible in the localization, and thus      In , every element of becomes a unit. The following universal property says roughly that is the smallest -algebra in which every element of is a unit.    Theorem 3.55. Let be a commutative ring, and a multiplicative set with . Let be an -algebra in which every element of is a unit. Then there is a unique homomorphism such that the following diagram commutes:   where the vertical map is the structure homomorphism and the horizontal map is the canonical homomorphism.    Proof. Given an -algebra such that every element of is a unit, where the algebra structure is induced by the ring homomorphism , consider the map     First, note that our assumption that every element of is invertible in means that is invertible in , and thus makes sense. Moreover, we claim that is a ring homomorphism:     and moreover     and     Our definition of gives us     as desired. Moreover, if is any ring homomorphism such that     then     This proves our uniqueness claim.      Definition 3.56. Let be a commutative ring and let be a multiplicative subset of . The localization at is the functor -Mod -mod that sends each -module to the -module , and that sends each -module homomorphism to the homomorphism of -modules given by     We might denote this functor by or . When is the complement of a prime ideal , we write the localization at as .     Show that for all -module homomorphisms ,   is a homomorphism of modules over .    Show that localization is an exact additive functor.     Theorem 3.57. Let be a commutative ring, and a multiplicative subset of . Then the localization at and are naturally isomorphic functors. In particular, for every -module , there is an isomorphism of -modules     and given an -module map , the map of -modules corresponds to under these isomorphisms.    Proof. The bilinear map      induces a homomorphism that is surjective.  For an inverse map, set . To see this is well-defined, suppose , so there exists some such that . Then,     We can multiply through by to get     To see this is a homomorphism, we note that     and     The composition sends     Since this is the identity on simple tensors, and simple tensors generated the tensor product, it must be the identity.  For the claim about maps, we need check that for every -module homomorphism . And indeed,     Finally, we note that our isomorphisms give a natural isomorphism between the localization functor and the tensor functor . Indeed, given a map of -modules , the diagram   commutes, since it commutes for simple tensors:   Now since localization is exact, we conclude that is an exact functor for all commutative rings and all multiplicatively closed subsets .     Let be a commutative noetherian ring, be a multiplicative set, be a finitely generated -module, and an arbitrary -module. Show that     In particular, if is prime,      Localization is a very powerful tool in commutative algebra. Many important concepts localize well, in the sense that to prove that or a module satisfy a certain property, it is often sufficient to show that all localizations of or of that module also have that property. This is a very common and helpful technique in commutative algebra. For example, a module is zero if and only if all its localizations are zero; one can even reduce to showing all localizations of at a prime ideal are zero.  One important thing to keep in mind, however, is that if is a finitely generated module, a localization of is typically not finitely generated over , though it is finitely generated over .   Let be a domain and let be a nonzero nonunit. Then is not a finitely generated -module.   To solve this exercise, however, one needs a little bit of commutative algebra that we are not covering in this course.  "

These structures can be a bit confusing at first - especially since we have left module structures written on the right and vice-versa. While the exercise is not difficult, it can be extremely enlightening - we strongly recommend the reader tries their hand at the details.  The following statements are known as Hom-tensor adjunction - and as we will see, they do encode an adjunction of functors.    Let and be rings. Assume that     is a right -module,     is an -bimodule, and     is a right -module.    There is a natural isomorphism of abelian groups     If also has a -bimodule structure, or has a -bimodule structure, then this is an isomorphism of (left or right, respectively) -modules.

There is a natural isomorphism of abelian groups       We leave the details to the reader, and prove the case when the underlying rings are commutative. First, let's do the case when .    Theorem 3.60 (Hom-tensor adjunction I). Let be a commutative ring and let , and be -modules. There is an isomorphism of -modules     that is natural on , and .    Proof. The universal property of the tensor product says that to give an -module homomorphism is the same as giving an -bilinear map . Given such a bilinear map , the map is -linear for each , so it defines an -module homomorphism . Now the assignment     is -linear, is an -module homomorphism, and is -linear on .  Conversely, given an -module homomorphism , one can check (exercise!) that is an -bilinear map, so it induces an -module homomorphism . Moreover, the two constructions are inverse to each other.  So we have constructed a bijection of Hom-sets     It's routine to check that both of these bijections are indeed homomorphisms of -modules, so we leave it as an exercise.  Finally, naturality means we have the following commutative diagrams:   and   We leave checking these do indeed commute as an exercise.      Corollary 3.61 (Tensor and Hom are adjoint functors). Let be a commutative ring, and an -module. The functor -Mod -Mod is left adjoint to the functor -Mod -Mod.    Proof. The adjointness translates into the fact that for all -modules and there is a bijection     which is natural on and , which is a corollary of Theorem 3.60.    Later, when we talk about more general abelian categories, we will see that this adjunction implies that Hom is left exact and that tensor is right exact; in fact, this is a more general fact about adjoint pairs. For now, we want to discuss a more general version of this Hom-tensor adjunction.    Theorem 3.62 (Hom-tensor adjunction II). Let be a ring homomorphism of commutative rings. Let be an -module, and and be -modules. There is an isomorphism of abelian groups     Moreover, this isomorphism is natural on , and , so it induces natural isomorphisms    between and .    between and .    between and .      Proof. Consider the map     Fix . For each , let be the map defined by . Note that is indeed a homomorphism of -modules, since it is the composition of two -module maps, and , where is the constant map equal to .  We should check that our proposed map is indeed a map of abelian groups. It is immediate from the definition that sends the 0-map to the 0-map. Moreover, given module homomorphisms , and any , we have     so for all , and thus .  Suppose that . Then for every and every ,     so vanishes at every simple tensor, and we must have . On the other hand, if we are given , consider the map defined by . Since is a homomorphism of -modules, it is -linear on . Moreover, for each fixed is a homomorphism of -modules, so in particular is -linear. Together, these say that is an -bilinear map. Let be the homomorphism of -modules induced by . By definition, , so . We conclude that is a bijection.  We leave the statements about naturality as exercises.      Corollary 3.63 (Adjointness of restriction and extension of scalars). Let be ring homomorphism. The restriction of scalars functor -Mod -Mod is the right adjoint of the extension of scalars functor -Mod -Mod.    Proof. We need to show that for every -module and every -module there are bijections     which are natural on both and . By Theorem 3.62, we have natural bijections     The module is precisely . By Exercise as an -module. An isomorphism of -modules is in particular an -linear map, and thus also an isomorphism of -modules. So as -modules. Therefore, the Hom-tensor adjuntion gives us the natural bijections we were looking for.    The idea is that restriction of scalars and extension of scalars are the most efficient ways of making an -module out of an -module, and vice-versa.  "

In this chapter, we introduce these three classes of modules (projective, injective, and flat modules) and study their properties. Throughout, we consider general rings and left modules.  Projective Module   Let be a ring. An -module is projective if given any surjective -module homomorphism and any -module homomorphism , there exists an -module homomorphism such that the diagram   commutes. projective module      The commutativity of the diagram   says that , where is the induced by . Whenever this happens, we say that is a lifting of , and that lifts, or that factors through . lift    There are projective modules over any ring, as the next result shows; in fact, free modules are always projective.  Free Modules are Projective   Free modules are projective.    Let be a free -module. Suppose we are given -module homomorphisms and such that is surjective. Fix a basis for . Since is surjective, for each we can choose such that . Consider the function given by . The universal property of free modules says that there exists an -module homomorphism that coincides with for all basis elements. Now so agrees with for all basis elements. Since generates , we conclude that .    Projective modules are precisely those that make the covariant functor exact.    Let be an -module. The functor is exact if and only if is projective.    By  is left exact. The statement is that is projective if and only for any short exact sequence the induced map is surjective. Say we are given a surjective map   The induced map is surjective if and only if for every there exists a lifting of , meaning . By , the existence of such a for all such surjective maps is precisely the condition that is projective.     This is really the definition of what a projective module is, but for those that have not seen category theory, the definition given is used.     For any ring is exact. More generally, if is any free -module, then is exact.    By , free modules, and in particular, are projective. By , must be exact for any free -module .    However, not every projective module is free. But before we see such examples, we need to know a bit more about projective modules.   Direct Summands         First, we show that we can rephrase the condition that a module is projective or injective in terms of split exact sequences.  Projective Modules and Splitting   An -module is projective if and only if every short exact sequence splits.     Consider a short exact sequence   If is projective, the identity map on lifts to a map , meaning that   commutes. This says that our map  is a splitting for our short exact sequence, which must then be split, by Lemma 2.19.   Conversely, suppose that every short exact sequence splits, and consider any diagram   Let be a free module that surjects onto - for example, the free module on a set of generators of - and fix a surjection . By assumption, the short exact sequence splits, so by there exists such that . Now since is free, we can define an -module map that such that   commutes, by sending each basis element to any lift of in via . Now set , and note that so is a lift of by .    We have seen that free modules are projective; what other modules are projective?

For every -module , there exists a free module surjecting onto . If is finitely generated, we can take to be finitely generated.    We will often need only a weaker version of this: that every module is a quotient of a projective module.      Projective modules are exactly the modules that make exact.

  "body": "Injective Modules        Definition and Baer's Criterion         Injective modules are dual to projectives.  Injective Module   An -module is injective if given an injective -module homomorphism and an -module homomorphism , there exist an -module homomorphism such that   commutes.    These are precisely the modules such that is exact.    An -module is injective if and only if is exact, meaning that for every short exact sequence we get an exact sequence     By , is left exact, so for any short exact sequence we get an exact sequence   So the content of the theorem is that is injective if and only if for every injective -module homomorphism , the induced map is surjective. Now notice that is surjective if and only if every lifts to some , meaning   commutes. That is precisely what we want for to be injective.    Giving examples of injective modules is much harder than giving examples of projective modules, but we will see some examples later. First, we prove some properties of injective modules.  The class of injectives modules is closed for products and finite direct sums.    Given any family of injective modules, is injective.    Let be the projection onto the th factor. Given any diagram   the fact that is injective gives us -module homomorphisms such that   commutes for each . Now the -module homomorphism makes the diagram   commute, so is injective.      If is an injective -module, then so are and .    Any diagram   can be extended to a map by composing with the inclusion of the first factor. Since is injective, there exists such that   commutes. Let be the projection onto , so that . Now if we set ,        Baer Criterion   An -module is injective if and only if every -module homomorphism from an ideal in can be extended to the whole ring, meaning that there exists making the diagram   commute.    On the one hand, if is injective then our condition is simply a special case of the definition of injective module. On the other hand, suppose that this condition holds, and consider any diagram   To simplify notation, let's assume our map is indeed the inclusion of the submodule , so we can write for the image of in . Consider the set   First, notice is nonempty, since . Moreover, we can partially order by setting if and . So we have a nonempty partially ordered set; let's show we can apply Zorn's Lemma to it.  Given a chain in , meaning a sequence of nested submodules and maps that extend all with , let , and define   Since all the are homomorphisms of -modules, this map is indeed a map of -modules. Moreover, is well-defined, since the whenever . By construction, this map extends all the , so we conclude that is an upper bound for our chain. Moreover, follows immediately from our construction, and since each extends , so does . We conclude that , and more generally that any chain in has an upper bound in . So Zorn's Lemma applies.  By Zorn's Lemma, has a maximal element, say . We claim that . Suppose not, and let be an element not in . One can check that is an ideal in , and that is an -module homomorphism.  By assumption, we can extend to an -module homomorphism , which we will write as as well. Now the -module homomorphism is well-defined by construction, since any satisfies , and if then . Finally, this map agrees with on , and thus it agrees with on , so and . By the maximality of , we conclude that , and thus , which is a contradiction. We conclude that . Therefore, makes the diagram   commute.     Divisible Modules         It is very easy to see that every -module is a quotient of a free module. The dual statement is true as well, but it is a little more delicate.  Divisible Module   An -module is divisible if for every nonzero and every there exists such that .     Remark 4.22. Given , and an -module , the multiplication by map is an -module homomorphism. The module is divisible if and only if multiplication by is surjective for all nonzero .   Divisible Modules   The set of rational numbers , considered as a module over the ring of integers , is a divisible module. This is because for any nonzero integer , you can find a rational number such that is still a rational number.    Divisible Modules Closed Under Quotients   Any quotient of a divisible module is also divisible.    Let be a divisible -module and be a submodule of . Let and  . By assumption, there exists such that . The image of in is still a solution to , so indeed is divisible.    Closure Properties of Divisible Modules   Divisible modules are closed under taking submodules, quotients, direct sums, and localizations.    Injective Modules Divisible in Domains   Over a domain, every injective module is divisible.    Suppose that is an injective -module, where is a domain. Fix and . Since is a domain, we have for any . In particular, each element in can be written uniquely as for some . In particular, the map of -modules   is well-defined. Since is injective, we can extend this to a homomorphism . Finally, is an element such that , and is divisible.    This not true in general if we do not assume is a domain.  Injective but not Divisible Module  Example 4.25. Let be a field and . On the one hand, is not a divisible -module, since there is no such that . On the other hand, is actually an injective module over itself, although we do not have the tools to justify that this is indeed an injective -module.    The converse of does not hold in general, and quotients of injective modules are not necessarily injective.  Injective Modules not Closed Under Quotients  Let , where is a field, let be the fraction field of . The -module is divisible but not injective.   But the converse of does hold for some special classes of rings.  Injective iff Divisible in PID   Let be a principal ideal domain. An -module is injective if and only it is divisible.    Given , we only need to show that divisible modules are injective. By Baer's Criterion, we only need to show that any map from an ideal to can be extended to the whole ring. So let be a divisible -module, and consider any map from an ideal to . If , we could extend our map by taking the map from to , so we might as well assume that . By assumption, for some , and since is divisible, there exists such that . Now consider the multiplication by map, For every , so extends . Therefore, by Theorem 4.18, is injective.    Injectives Closed Under Quotients in PIDs   Over a principal ideal domain, quotients of injective modules are injective.    If is injective, it is also divisible, by . Given any submodule , any , and a nonzero , there exists such that , and so this also holds in . Then is divisible, and thus injective by . Using fancy words you might learn in Commutative Algebra II, this ring is an example of a complete intersection, which is a subclass of Gorenstein rings. Moreover, - this is something you'd learn about in Commutative Algebra II. Now it turns out (and this is a nontrivial fact) that Gorenstein rings of dimension 0 are injective modules over themselves.     Given an injective abelian group, we can always use it to construct an injective -module over our favorite ring .    Given an injective abelian group and a ring is an injective -module.    Let . This abelian group is an -module, via   We claim that is actually an injective -module. By , it is sufficient to prove that is an exact functor. By , is naturally isomorphic to . This last functor is the composition of   On the one hand, is naturally isomorphic to the identity on -Mod, by , so it is exact. On the other hand, is an injective -module, so is exact by . The composition of exact functors is exact, and thus is exact.     Example 4.29. Since is a divisible abelian group, by for any ring the -module is injective.    Every Module Embeds into an Injective Module         When we talked about projective modules, we showed that every module is a quotient of a projective - in fact, every module is a quotient of a free module. The dual statement is true as well: that every module embeds into an injective module. We will soon see that these two statements are extremely important.  While the statement about projectives is relatively simple - it's essentially a consequence of the universal property of free modules - the fact about injectives is a lot more delicate; the work we just did on divisible modules was precisely so we could show this deep and important fact.  First, we show that every abelian group can be embedded into an injective abelian group.    Every abelian group is a submodule of some injective abelian group.    On the one hand, is a quotient of some free abelian group, say . Now embeds in , and thus embeds into a quotient of . By Example 4.20, is an injective abelian group, and by Corollary is an injective abelian group, since is a noetherian ring. By , any quotient of is also injective, so we have shown that embeds into an injective abelian group, say .  In fact, the proof above can be repeated over any PID: if is a PID, we can show that any -module embeds into an injective module, and in fact embeds into some number of copies of the fraction field .    We can finally show that over any ring, every module can be embedded into an injective module.    Every -module is a submodule of some injective -module.    First, by we can view as a subgroup of some injective abelian group . Let be the inclusion map and .  By , is an injective -module. Since Hom is left exact, by , preserves the inclusion , so we have an inclusion . Now consider the map   This is an -module homomorphism:   Given , so .    Given , and , so .     Moreover, if then . So is injective, and thus composing with our previous inclusion gives us an inclusion of into the injective -module . However, the inclusion is a priori only a map of abelian groups, so we should check that is indeed -linear. In order to do this, we need to be careful (at least in the case when is not commutative) with how we defined the left -module structure on in Exercise 56: this is a situation where we view as a -bimodule and as a left -module, so is a left -module via   The map we need to show is -linear is Regarding as a simple inclusion, simply views the element as an element of ; to simplify notation, we drop the : so for each is the map given by For every , and ,   so . This shows that is an inclusion of -modules.    And finally, just like we did for projectives, we can characterize injectives in terms of split short exact sequences.    An -module is injective if and only if every short exact sequence splits.    Let be an injective -module, and consider any short exact sequence Since is injective, there exists a map making   commute, and such a gives a splitting for our short exact sequence.  Conversely, suppose that every short exact sequence splits, and consider a diagram   By , embeds into some injective -module , say by the inclusion . By assumption, the short exact sequence splits, so there exists a map such that . Since is injective, we can lift through , obtaining an -module homomorphism such that   commutes. Now satisfies    commutes.    Before we move on from injective modules, let us say a word about how the story continues. The next chapter is quite beautiful, and it is a shame we have no time to discuss it in detail this semester.  We proved above that every module is a submodule of some injective module. One can even do better and talk about the smallest injective module that embeds in; this is called the injective hull of . One could describe by saying that it is the intersection of all the injective modules that contain , but this is not a very practical description. Injective hulls can also be described through the theory of essential extensions, a topic which we do not have time to discuss this semester. We leave the definition here just for fun, but we do not have the time to talk about it at length.    Let . We say is an essential extension of if every nonzero submodule intersects nontrivially, meaning . More generally, an injective map is an essential extension if is an essential extension in the sense above.    One then shows that an -module is injective if and only if it has no proper essential extensions . This proves that a maximal essential extension of is injective, and that there are no other injective modules with of . Moreover, one can show that any two maximal essential extension of are isomorphic - and thus we can talk about the maximal essential extension of , up to isomorphism, which is  But the theory of injectives, and injective hulls in particular, is much more complicated than the theory of projectives. When is a finitely generated module, we can always find a finitely generated projective (even free!) module surjecting onto ; in contrast, the injective hull might not be finitely generated - in fact, is typically not finitely generated even when is cyclic.  The story of the structure of injective modules then continues in a beautiful way. Over a noetherian ring, it turns out that every injective module can be decomposed into a direct sum of injective modules of the form , where is a prime ideal in . Moreover, the injective modules are the indecomposable injective modules, so the basic building blocks of injective modules. One can in fact compute the injective hull of any finitely generated -module very explicitly. A lot of this was proved in Eben Matlis' beautiful PhD thesis [Mat58], but sadly we do not have time for the details this semester. The details, however, are very important, for example to develop the theory of local cohomology - a topic which we will briefly mention later on.      Injective modules make exact.    The Baer Criterion tells us that a module is injective if and only if a map from an ideal to can be extended to all of .    In a domain injective modules are divisible and in a PID divisible modules are injective.    Every -module is a submodule of an injective module.     "

Therefore, is flat if and only if for every injective -module map ,    Direct Summands of Flat Modules are Flat   Given a family of -modules , the direct sum is flat if and only if every is flat. In particular, direct summands of flat modules are flat.    Given a family of -module homomorphisms , there is an -module homomorphism which is injective if and only if every is injective.  Let be an injective -module homomorphism. There is a commutative diagram where the horizontal maps are the isomorphisms from . In particular, is injective if and only if is injective. Moreover, is injective if and only if each component is injective, meaning is injective for all .  On the one hand, is flat if and only if for every injective map , the corresponding is injective. On the other hand, all the are flat if and only if for every injective map is injective for all , or equivalently, as explained above, if is injective for any given injective map . This translates into the equivalence we want to show.    All projectives are flat.  Every Projective Module is Flat   Let be any ring. Every projective -module is flat.    First, recall that is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor, by Lemma 3.40, and thus exact (see Remark 3.11). This shows that is flat, and thus any free module, being a direct sum of copies of , must also be flat by . Finally, every projective module is a direct summand of a free module, by . Direct summands of flat modules are flat, by , so every projective module is flat.    We can test whether a given module if flat by looking at the finitely generated submodules.  Flatness and Finitely Generated Submodules   If every finitely generated submodule of is flat, then is flat.    Let be an injective map of -modules. We want to show that is injective. Suppose that . We are going to construct a finitely generated submodule , with the inclusion, and an element such that and . Once we do that, our submodule is finitely generated, and thus flat by assumption, so is injective; therefore, and thus we must have . Therefore, is injective, and we conclude that is flat.  Let's say that . In , we constructed the tensor product as a quotient of the free module on by the submodule with all the necessary relations we need to impose. This gives us a short exact sequence The fact that means we can rewrite this element as for some . This element is a linear combination of elements of finitely many . Let be all the -coordinates of those elements.  Now we take to be the finitely generated submodule of generated by and , and . Now and as desired.    The reason we needed to add in these extra elements is that a priori is not necessarily a submodule of , so we do not necessarily have in without adding in all relations that make it true.   Torsion Submodules         Torsion Submodule   Let be a domain and be an -module. The torsion submodule of is The elements of are called torsion elements , and we say that is torsion if . Finally, is torsion free if .    Closure Properties of Torsion Free Modules   Torsion free modules are closed under taking submodules, quotients, direct sums, and localizations.    Flat Implies Torision Free in Domains   If is a domain and is a flat -module, then is torsion free.    Let be the fraction field of , which is a torsion free -module. Now is a -vector space, so isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of . In particular, is torsion free as an -module. Since is flat, the inclusion induces an injective -module map and since , by , we conclude that is isomorphic to a submodule of . By , submodules of torsion free modules are also torsion free, so is torsion free.    In general, the converse does not hold.  Torsion Free but not Flat Module  Example 4.41. Let be a field and . Consider the ideal . This is a submodule of the torsion free module , and thus torsion free by . However, it is not flat. For example, when we apply to the inclusion we obtain a map of -vector spaces   This map cannot possibly be injective: is a -dimensional -vector space, while is -dimensional.   The converse does hold over a PID.  Flat iff Torsion Free in PID   If is a principal ideal domain, an -module is flat if and only if it is torsion free.     This is just a special case of .   Suppose is a torsion free finitely generated -module. The structure theorem for PIDs says that must be isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of cyclic modules. The cyclic module has torsion (all the elements are killed by ) unless . Therefore, must be isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of , and thus free. By , is projective, and by projectives are flat, so is flat.  Now let be any torsion free -module. All of the finitely generated submodules of are also torsion free by , and thus flat by what we have shown so far. By , must be flat.    Not all flat modules are projective.  Flat but not Projective Module  Example 4.43. The -module is torsion free and thus flat, by . However, is not a projective -module. Suppose by contradiction, that is a projective -module. By , must be a direct summand of a free module, say . Consider the inclusion , and pick such that the image of contains some element with a nonzero entry in the component. Now consider the projection onto the th factor. By assumption, the composition is nonzero. However, there are no nontrivial abelian group homomorphisms , contradicting the fact that is nonzero. We conclude that is not projective.   However, for finitely generated modules over a commutative noetherian local ring, every flat module is free, and thus flat, projective, and free all coincide. However, to prove that we need a little bit of commutative algebra, which we introduce in the next section.  Finally, here is a very important example: localization is flat.  Flatness of Localization   Let be a commutative ring, and a multiplicative subset of . Then is flat over .    By , tensoring with is localizing at . But localization is exact, so tensoring with is exact, and thus is a flat -module.     If is a domain then its fraction field is a flat module.            "

First, some notation: when is a local ring, meaning has a unique maximal ideal , we write to denote the ring and its maximal ideal. Now note that for any -module , the module is annihilated by , so it is also a module over a ring , which is a field.  The following is a classical result in commutative algebra, known by some as Nakayama's Lemma. As noted in [Mat89, page 8], Nakayama himself claimed that this should be attributed to Krull and Azumaya, but it's not clear which of the three actually had the commutative ring statement first. So some authors (eg, Matsumura) prefer to refer to it as NAK. There are actually a range of statements, rather than just one, that go under the banner of Nakayama's Lemma a.k.a. NAK.  Theorem . Let be a local ring, and be a finitely generated module. If , then .  The theorem above is the theorem most commonly referred to as NAK. The proof involves only elementary tools, and a fun linear algebra-inspired trick called the Determinantal Trick. While we will not include the details here, they can be found in any standard Commutative Algebra book. We will however use this result to prove another statement that is also commonly referred to as NAK, which allows us to talk about minimal generating sets for finitely generated modules over local rings.  Remark 4.46. Let be any commutative ring, and consider an -module and an ideal . If , meaning that for all and all , then can be given the structure of an -module, as follows: for any and any , The fact that kills is what makes this action well-defined. The fact that is actually an -module under this action is a consequence of the fact that is an -module; checking these details is routine, and we leave them as an exercise.  Notice that the structure of as an -module is essentially the same as its structure as an -module. There are many properties of as an -module that pass onto its module structure, and typically such results are easy to check.  Here is a special case of this: if is a commutative local ring, and is an -module, then the module is killed by , and thus it is also a module over . Now notice that is a field, so is actually a vector space over the field .  Theorem 4.47. Let be a commutative local ring, and be a finitely generated module. For , Thus, any generating set for consists of at least elements.  Proof. The implication is clear. For , given such that generate , consider     Since is generated by the image of , we have . By taking the quotient by , we see that     By Theorem 4.45, and thus .  As we mentioned above, this allows us to talk about minimal generating sets.  Definition 4.48. Let be a local ring, and a finitely generated module. A set of elements is a minimal generating set of if the images of form a basis for the vector space .  Note that every finitely generated module over a local ring has a minimal generating set, that every minimal generating set has the same number of elements, and that any set of generators for contains a minimal generating set, all thanks to plain old linear algebra. In particular, we can now define the following:  Definition 4.49. Let be a finitely generated module over a commutative local ring . The minimal number of generators of , denoted ,, is the number of elements in any minimal generating set for .  We now have all the key commutative algebra ingredients needed to show that for finitely generated modules over a noetherian local ring, projective free. However, the proof follows more easily with one more homological tool we haven't developed yet, so we will hold off on proving this for now - in fact, you will soon be able to prove it easily, so this will be in the next problem set.  Exercise 58. Let be a commutative local ring, and let be a finitely presented module. Then     Kaplansky [Kap58] showed that this holds even for modules that are not necessarily finitely presented, but generated by countably many elements.  Definition 4.50. An -module is locally free if is free for every prime ideal .  Exercise 59. Let be a commutative ring, and be -modules, and be a prime ideal. Show that     Exercise 60. Let be a commutative ring, be a prime ideal, and be an -module. Let be as an -module via restriction of scalars. Then as -modules, we have an isomorphism     Exercise 61. Let be a commutative ring. Show that a homomorphism of -modules is surjective if and only if is surjective for all primes .   Let be a noetherian ring, be a multiplicative set, be a finitely generated -module, and an arbitrary -module. Show that     In particular, if is prime,      Theorem 4.51. Let be a commutative noetherian ring and let be a finitely presented -module. Then     Proof. We already know that projectives are flat, by Theorem 4.37.  Suppose is flat. We claim that is flat for every prime ideal . First, note that , by Theorem 3.57; moreover, is a flat -module by Exercise 53 . Note moreover that any -module can also be viewed as an -module by extension of scalars along the canonical localization map. Now given any short exact sequence of -modules, say     tensoring with over can be done in two steps: first we view this as a short exact sequence of -modules, and tensor with , but is a flat -module, so     is exact. Then we tensor with , but this is also flat -module, so we get a short exact sequence again:     By Theorem 3.57 and Exercise 59, for each -module we have     But , by ??, so we conclude that     Thus     is exact, and is a flat -module.  So whenever is flat, is a flat -module for all primes . By Exercise must be free over for all primes , that is, is locally free.  Finally, suppose that is locally free. We want to show that is projective. So by Theorem 4.4, we need to show that for all surjective -module maps , the map is surjective. By Exercise 61 , it is enough to show that is surjective for all primes . By Exercise 62,     and     But i free, and thus projective by Theorem 4.3, so is surjective. Since this holds for all , by Exercise 61 we conclude that is surjective, and thus is projective.  Note that the noetherianity assumption is just so that finitely generated implies finitely presented; the statement is also true for a general commutative ring if instead of finitely generated modules we take finitely presented.

  "title": "Projective Resolutions",
  "body": "Projective Resolutions        Definition, Existence, Examples         To describe an -module , we need to know a set of generators and the relations among those generators. If we continue that process, and ask for relations among the relations (treating the relations as generators for the module of relations), and relations among the relations among the relations, and so on, we construct what is known as a free resolution for . Free resolutions play a key role in many important constructions, and encode a lot of interesting information about our module. For example, if the module came from some geometric setting, geometric information about the module gets reflected in the free resolution. Studying the resolutions of all finitely generated modules over a ring also tells us important information about the ring itself, and its singularities.  In this chapter we will introduce free resolutions, and more generally projective resolutions, as well as their injective counterpart. We will also study free resolutions in a bit more detail over commutative local noetherian rings, and the graded analogue. For more details on the basics of graded free resolutions, we recommend Irena Peeva's excellent book [Pee11].  Projective Resolution   Let be an -module. A projective resolution is a complex   where all the are projective, , and for all . We may also write a projective resolution for as an exact sequence where all the modules are projective. The resolution is free if all the are free.    You will find both these definitions in the literature, often indicating the second option as an abuse of notation. We will be a bit sloppy and consider both equivalently, since at the end of the day they contain the same information. One often uses the word acyclic to refer to a complex that is exact everywhere except at homological degree ; but we caution the reader that some authors use the word acyclic to refer to exact complexes. For that reason, we will avoid the word acyclic altogether.  Every Module has a Free Resolution   Every -module has a free resolution, and thus it has a projective resolution.    Let be an -module. We are going to construct a projective resolution quite explicitly. The first step is to find a projective module that surjects onto . In fact, we can find a free module surjecting onto , by . Now consider the kernel of that projection, say Set . There exists a free module surjecting onto , again by . Now the map satisfies .   Now the process continues analougously. We find a free module surjecting onto ker , and set   At each stage, is a surjective map, ker is the inclusion of the kernel of into , and we get short exact sequences In fact, . We can continue this process for as long as , and the resulting sequence will be a projective resolution for .    A free resolution gives us a detailed description of our module :    gives us generators for .     gives us generators for all the relations among our generators for .    The next module describes the relations among the relations among our generators. And so on.     Length of Projective Resolution   If is a projective resolution of , we say that has length if for all and . If no such exists, we say that has infinite length. If has no finite projective resolution, we say that has infinite projective dimension; otherwise, the projective dimension of is the smallest length of a projective resolution.    Projective Dimension iff Projective  A module has if and only is projective. Indeed, note that if is projective, then is a projective resolution of . On the other hand, if has a projective resolution then exactness tells us that .   Projective Resolution for over  Let us construct a free resolution for over . First, since has only one generator, we can start with the canonical surjection . Note that is generated by just one element again, so we can take But now the map is injective, so we are done, and is a free resolution for . This shows that . Also, is not projective: we showed in that is not exact. Thus .   Projective Resolution for over  Consider a field and . Let us construct a free resolution for . We can start with the canonical surjection ; the kernel is , which is cyclic, so our resolution begins with Now the kernel of is , which is again cyclic. Our resolution continues with Next, we need to compute the kernel of multiplication by ; but that is , a cyclic module, and the next step in the resolution is But now we have a repeating pattern! Our two-periodic resolution goes on forever: In fact, it turns out that . But to really justify that, we need to understand that this is a minimal free resolution.    A Brief Introduction to Graded Modules         To talk about minimal free resolutions we need some reasonable conditions to hold. For the rest of the section, all rings will be commutative, and in fact we will be focusing on two types of rings: commutative local rings or -graded algebras over fields.    When is a field, the polynomial ring can be given an -grading by setting for some . The most common -grading, also known as the standard grading, is the one where we declare for all . Once we declare the degrees of the variables, we can extend that grading to all monomials as follows:       A homogeneous element in is any -linear combination of monomials of the same degree. We write for the set of all homogeneous elements of degree , which is an abelian group under addition, and note that Note also that for all and .    More generally, a graded ring is any ring that can be decomposed in pieces of this form, meaning that The elements in are called homogeneous elements of degree . Similarly, a graded  - module is a module such that   A homomorphism of graded -modules that such that for all is a graded map of degree . Any graded map can be thought of as a map of degree by shifting degrees. We write for the graded -module with .  When is standard graded,   Note here that can be though of as a homogeneous element of any degree; one sometimes declares . An ideal in is a homogeneous ideal if it can be generated by homogeneous elements; one can show that this is equivalent to   Finally, whenever itself is homogeneous, the grading on passes onto , with   We will be concerned with finitely generated -graded -algebras with , which are of the form for some homogeneous ideal . One nice feature of such rings is that while there might be many maximal ideals, there is only one homogeneous maximal ideal, which is given by     In many ways, the behavior of such a graded ring and its unique homogeneous maximal ideal is an analogue to the behavior of a local ring and its unique maximal ideal ideal , though one always needs to provide a separate proof for the graded and local versions.   Uniqueness of Minimal Projective Resolutions         Minimal Complex   Let be either a commutative local ring or a commutative -graded -algebra with and homogeneous maximal ideal . A complex is minimal if for all .     Remark 5.8. A complex is minimal if and only if the differentials in the complex are all identically . If all the are free, fix a basis for each . The differentials can be represented by matrices, though possibly infinite. We will be primarily interested in the case of finitely generated modules over noetherian rings, which are finitely presented, so all the are finitely generated as well, and each corresponds to some finite matrix. In this case, our complex is minimal if and only if all the entries in the matrices representing are in , whatever our chosen bases are.     Let be a commutative ring. Suppose is either a local ring or an graded -algebra with and homogeneous maximal ideal . Let be a finitely generated (graded) -module. A free resolution for is a minimal complex if and only if for all the module is the free module on a minimal set of generators for , which in the graded case must be homogeneous.    Suppose there exists an such that is the free module on some non-minimal set of generators for ; so there is a basis for such that , and the images of in the vector space are linearly dependent. Then there exists , not all in , such that in . In the graded case, we can take all these coefficients to be homogeneous. At least one of these coefficients is not in , and thus it must be invertible, In the graded case, homogeneous elements not in are nonzero elements in , and thus invertible. so we can multiply by its inverse. So perhaps after reordering our elements, we get   Then is not in , so .  Now suppose that im for some . Let be a basis for , so that form a generating set for . By assumption, contains some (homogeneous, in the graded case) element that is not in . So there is an element not in . In particular, some , which we can assume without loss of generality to be . Multiplying by the inverse of , we get some such that so This is a nontrivial relation among our chosen set of generators of , which must then be non-minimal.    So to construct a minimal free resolution of , we simply take as few generators as possible in each step. Ultimately, we can talk about the minimal free resolution of . To show that, we need some definitions and a lemma.  Direct Sum of Complexes   Let and be complexes of -modules. The direct sum of and is the complex of -modules that has , with differentials given by   together with the complex maps and given by the corresponding inclusion in each homological degree.     Show that the direct sum of complexes is the coproduct in the category .     The homology of a direct sum is the direct sum of the homologies.    Notice and Thus      More generally, this is true because Ch(R) is an abelian category, where all additive functors preserve direct sums.   Direct Summands in  Suppose that is a subcomplex of , and that we know that each is a direct summand of , say by . In order for to be a free summand of , we also need that the differentials of behave well with : for each , we need to check that and . This does not always hold.   Trivial Complex   A complex of -modules is trivial if it is a direct sum of complexes of the form     Trival Complex  The complex is trivial.   Trivial Complexes are Exact  Trivial complexes are exact: they are the direct sums of exact complexes, and by taking homology commutes with direct sums.     Let be either a commutative local ring or a commutative -graded -algebra with and homogeneous maximal ideal . Every (graded) complex of finitely generated (graded) free -modules that is exact everywhere must be trivial.    Since is projective, says that the short exact sequence splits, so . In fact, is the canonical projection map , and our original exact sequence breaks off as   In particular, since is trivial and homology commutes with taking direct sums of complexes, by , we conclude that is also exact everywhere. In particular, we have also shown that ker is a (graded) direct summand of the (graded) free -module . In the local case, is a projective by , and thus free by .  In the graded setting, ?? says that ker is free. So we are back at our original situation, and we can repeat the same argument repeatedly to show that our complex breaks off as the direct sum of the trivial complexes and must therefore be trivial.      Let be a complex of projective -modules, and let be an exact complex. Every -module map lifts to a map of complexes , and any two such lifts are homotopic.  Moreover, if is a commutative graded -algebra, and are finitely generated graded -modules, and are finitely generated graded -modules, and is a degree-preserving homomorphism, then the induced map of complexes is made out of degree-preserving module maps.    Since is projective and is surjective, there exists an -module homomorphism such that   commutes. Notice in fact that so . In the graded case, note that we can define by sending the elements in a homogeneous basis of to homogeneous such that .  We now proceed by induction. Suppose we have constructed such that . Since is projective, there exists a map such that   commutes. And again,   so .  We can now inductively construct our map of complexes lifting .  Now suppose we are given two such maps of complexes lifting , say and . Note that and 0 are two liftings of the zero map. We are going to show that any map lifting the zero map must be nullhomotopic, which will then imply that and are homotopic as well (essentially via the same homotopy!).  So let be a map of complexes lifting the zero map , so that the following commutes:   We will explicitly construct a nullhomotopy for by induction. First, set for all . The commutativity of the rightmost square tells us that , so   Since is projective, there exists an -module homomorphism such that   commutes, and thus . Notice also that so .  Now assume that we have constructed maps such that and . Since is projective, we can find a map such that   commutes, so . Now   So we again obtain . By induction, this process allows us to construct our homotopy .    Uniqueness of Minimal Free Resolutions   Let be a commutative ring, either a local ring or a -graded graded -algebra with and homogeneous maximal ideal . If is a minimal free resolution of , then any free resolution for is isomorphic to a direct sum of with a trivial complex. In particular, the minimal free resolution of is unique up to isomorphism.    Suppose that is another free resolution of . By , there are complex maps and that lift the identity map on . Then is a map of complexes that lifts the identity on , and thus by  must be homotopic to the identity on . Let be a homotopy between and the identity, so that for all , Since is minimal, we have and , so for all . Our first goal will be to show that is an isomorphism.  First we do the local case. Let be the matrix representing in some fixed basis for , and note that is represented by , so all the entries in must be in . Our matrix can be written as for some , so that for some . In particular, is invertible, and is an isomorphism.  In the graded case, we have to be a bit more careful: not all elements that are not in are invertible, this is only true for homogeneous elements. First, we fix a basis of homogeneous elements for with , and set id . Since our map is degree-preserving, is homogeneous for each , and so we can write as a linear combination of our basis elements using only pieces of degree . We obtain a matrix such that , and represents , meaning for all . Now all the entries of must be in, so in particular we must have for all . Moreover, since we chose our basis to have increasing degrees, whenever . Since we must also have whenever , we conclude that for . We conclude that is an upper triangular matrix. Finally, , and is invertible.  So we have shown in both cases that is an isomorphism for all . By , is in fact an isomorphism of complexes, so let be its inverse. Now we want to claim that splits as a map of complexes. Notice that so let us take to be our proposed splitting for . Note that implies that our map provides splittings for the -module maps in each degree, by , so . We just need to prove that this splitting holds as complexes, that is, that as complexes. So let , and denote the differential in by . We need to check that and .  Since is a map of complexes, , so we do get . Given , we can write for some and , since . Then since is a splitting for since by assumption since is a map of complexes since is a map of complexes since .  We conclude that , and . We have now shown that .  Finally, we are going to show that is a trivial complex. First, we claim that is free for all . We have already shown that is a (graded) direct summand of a (graded) free module. In the local case, says that is projective, and then says that must in fact be free. In the graded setting, one can show that any graded module which is a direct sum of a finitely generated graded -module is a graded free module. In both cases, is free.  Since , we have . Since and are both (graded) free resolutions for , they have the same homology: for all , and . We conclude that is exact everywhere. Finally, shows that is trivial.    Horseshoe Lemma   Consider a short exact sequence of modules Let be a projective resolution of , and be a projective resolution of . There exists a projective resolution of and maps of complexes and lifting and such that is a short exact sequence of complexes.    First, we need to introduce some general notation: given homomorphisms and with the same target, we will write for the homomorphism given by . Moreover, we will denote the differential of by , and the differential of by .  For each , set , and let and be the canonical projections. By , is projective for all . Moreover, we get short exact sequences for all . We will construct the missing differentials inductively.  Since is projective and is surjective, there exists such that   commutes. Set . The universal property of the coproduct guarantees that   commutes. By the , is surjective. By the , is exact. We then proceed by induction, and at each step we apply the base case to   where the vertical arrows are surjective because and are projective resolutions and thus exact. Notice that by construction, the image of is contained in , which guarantees that is a differential.  This inductive process allows us to build a complex of projectives and a short exact sequence of complexes Applying the , we get exact sequences for all , and thus . Moreover, we constructed so that is exact, and thus . We conclude that is a projective resolution of .     why its called that    Syzygys and Betti Numbers         Now that we know that minimal free resolutions exist and are unique (in the local and graded settings), we will take the rest of this section to briefly discuss how minimal free resolutions contain a lot of important information about our modules. For example, we want to keep track of the kernels of the differentials in a minimal free resolution.  Syzygy   Let be a commutative ring, either a local ring or an -graded -algebra with and homogeneous maximal ideal . Let be a minimal free resolution for the finitely generated (graded) -module . For each , the submodule is the th syzygy of .     For each , we have a short exact sequence But and , so we get a short exact sequence    Syzygies are indeed well-defined up to isomorphism.  Syzygy's Are Well-Defined   Syzygies are indeed well-defined up to isomorphism.    Suppose that and are two minimal free resolutions for . By , there exists an isomorphism between and , say . Since is a map of complexes, , and thus must send elements in ker into elements in . Similarly, an inverse to sends ker into ker . In each homological degree, the induced maps and are inverse, and thus isomorphisms. In the graded case, one can show that we obtain graded isomorphisms, so that the graded syzygies are also well-defined up to isomorphism.    The number of generators in each homological degree is also an important invariant.  Betti Number   Let be a commutative ring, either a local ring or an -graded -algebra with and homogeneous maximal ideal . Let be a minimal free resolution for the finitely generated (graded) -module . The th betti number of is     In the graded case, we can also talk about graded betti numbers. When is a graded module, we can write a resolution that keeps track of the grading.  Betti Table   Let be a commutative -graded graded -algebra with and homogeneous maximal ideal . Let be a graded -module. The th betti number of , counts the number of generators of in degree . We often collect the betti numbers of a module in its betti table :     0  1  2     0        1        2                 By convention, the entry corresponding to in the betti table of contains , and . This is how Macaulay2 displays betti tables.   Let and . The minimal free resolution for is   From this minimal resolution, we can read the betti numbers of :    , since is a cyclic module;     , and these three quadratic generators live in degree 2;     , and these represent linear syzygies on quadrics, and thus live in degree 3 .     To write a graded free resolution for , we choose all maps to have degree , so that the graded free modules in each degree are sums of copies of shifts of . Here is the graded free resolution of :   Notice that the graded shifts in lower homological degrees affect all the higher homological degrees as well. For example, when we write the map in degree , we only need to shift the degree of each generator by , but since our map now lands on , we have to bump up degrees from to , and write . The graded betti number of counts the number of copies of in homological degree in our resolution. So we have   We can collect the graded betti numbers of in its betti table:     0  1  2     0  1       1   3  2       Let be a field, , and consider the ideal which has two generators of degree and one of degree , so there are graded betti numbers and . The minimal free resolution for is   So the betti table of is   In fact, even if all we know is the betti numbers of , there is lots of information to we can extract about .

These are the poster child examples of what are called derived functors, which can be constructed over any abelian category provided we have enough projective or injective objects. In this chapter, we will construct derived functors over (which does have enough injectives and enough projectives), and then later we will discuss the general construction.  We start with the general construction of derived functors, although we will soon focus on concrete examples, most importantly and , the derived functors of and tensor.  Derived functors   Let -Mod -Mod be a covariant right exact functor. The left derived functors of are a sequence of functors defined as follows:  For each -module , fix a projective resolution of , and set Given a -module homomorphism , fix projective resolutions of and of , and a map of complexes lifting .

The left derived functors of are a sequence of functors defined as follows:  For each object in , fix an injective resolution of , and set Given an arrow , fix injective resolutions and , and a map of complexes extending . Then     It is not clear a priori that this construction is well-defined, but we will soon show that is indeed the case.   If is exact, then , so for all .    If is projective, then is a projective resolution of , and thus for all . Similarly, if is injective then .

Forcing Exactness         And now we are ready to prove the most important result about derived functors: they fix the lack of exactness of the functor we are deriving, by inducing a long exact sequence in homology from any given short exact sequence.    Let a right exact covariant functor. Any short exact sequence induces a natural long exact sequence   Similarly, if is a left exact covariant functor, we obtain a long exact sequence   If is a contravariant left exact functor, we obtain a natural long exact sequence     We give a proof for the case of right exact functors, and the remaining cases follow by duality. We start by fixing projective resolutions of and of . By Theorem 7.58, we can choose a projective resolution of and lifts of and such that is a short exact sequence of complexes. By , does not depend on the choice of resolution, so we can compute , and from , and . Now notice that for each is projective, so is a split short exact sequence. Now additive functors preserve split short exact sequences, by , so is a short exact sequence for all . Then is a short exact sequence of complexes. Note, however, that this sequence is not necessarily split anymore, since the splittings at each level do not necessarily assemble into a map of complexes. The Long Exact Sequence in homology now gives us the long exact sequence we desire.  There were many choices along the way. First, we chose resolutions , and , and lifts of and . We have shown our computations of are independent of these choices. We should check, however, that the resulting connecting arrows are natural transformations that do not depend on our choice of lifts. Once a lift is fixed, we know we already have naturality from the Snake Lemma or the Long Exact Sequence in homology. It remains to check naturality. What is left to check is that given a commutative diagram with exact rows   and chosen lifts of the original short exact sequences to projective resolutions, there are maps of complexes such that   commutes. Our derived functors will preserve these maps of complexes and the commutativity of the diagram above, so we get commutative diagrams   for each . First, notice that we know that , and can be lifted to maps of complexes by , and that any two lifts of each , or are unique up to homotopy. So let's start by fixing lifts of and of , and we will construct an appropriate lift of . Since the short exact sequences   split for each , we might as well assume that and that the arrows and are given by the canonical arrows to and from the product coproduct in each homological degree. We cannot, however, assume as complexes, only that in each homological degree . The commutativity of   does imply that , so we can say that is of the form for each .

Now additive functors preserve split short exact sequences, by , so is a short exact sequence for all . Then is a short exact sequence of complexes. Note, however, that this sequence is not necessarily split anymore, since the splittings at each level do not necessarily assemble into a map of complexes. The Long Exact Sequence in homology now gives us the long exact sequence we desire.  There were many choices along the way. First, we chose resolutions , and , and lifts of and . We have shown our computations of are independent of these choices. We should check, however, that the resulting connecting arrows are natural transformations that do not depend on our choice of lifts. Once a lift is fixed, we know we already have naturality from the Snake Lemma or the Long Exact Sequence in homology. It remains to check naturality. What is left to check is that given a commutative diagram with exact rows   and chosen lifts of the original short exact sequences to projective resolutions, there are maps of complexes such that   commutes.

  "body": "A First Look at and        Double Complexes         It's time to return to study some concrete examples of derived functors: Ext, the derived functor of Hom, and Tor, the derived functor of tensor. Given two modules and , we may consider the derived functors of , and then plug in , or we may consider the derived functors of , and plug in ; it turns out that the two are naturally isomorphic, and this is the Tor functor:   More precisely, if is a projective resolution of , and is a projective resolution of ,   There are two Hom functors, each with its own derived functor: given -modules and , we may take a projective resolution of , and compute , or we could take an injective resolution of , and compute . It turns out these two completely different sounding constructions give us isomorphic -modules:   To show that for each of Ext and Tor these two seemingly unrelated definitions agree, we will need some more tools.  Suspension   The suspension or shift of a complex is the complex with   Given an integer , the th suspension of is the complex     Note that there are two conventions in the literature, the other one being .  Double Complex   A (homological) double complex over the ring is a family of -modules together with homomorphisms of -modules and  satisfying         Note that if is a double complex, then each row and each column is a complex: if we fix is a complex with differential ; if we fix is a complex with differential .   What we defined above is a homological double complex. A cohomological double complex would have vertical and horizontal maps that go up in index, and we instead write for the module in position . Also, please note that there are different conventions in the literature for whether refers to the row or column.  Total Complex   Given a double complex , its total complex is the complex given by   Similarly, the product total complex of is given by      Let be a double complex with differentials and . Then     so and are indeed complexes.   In order to prove our two definitions of Ext and Tor each agree, we will need two special double complexes: the tensor and the Hom double complex.  Tensor Product Double Complex   Let be a ring and and be complexes of -modules. The tensor product double complex of and is the double complex given by taking   We call the total complex of the tensor product double complex of and the tensor product of and in , and denote it by .     The tensor product total complex has and differential for and .   Double Complex   Let be a ring and and be complexes of -modules. The Hom double complex of and is the double complex given by with differentials   We call the product total complex of the Hom double complex of and the (internal) Hom complex of and , and denote it by .     The Hom complex of and is the complex with differential for each .    Given and in , what is a 0 -cycle in the Hom complex ? A 0 -cycle is a sequence of maps of -modules satisfying , so the 0 -cycles are precisely the maps of complexes . Similarly, a sequence of maps is a 0-boundary if there exists a sequence of maps such that . In other words, a 0-boundary indicates a homotopy relation - if is a 0-boundary, and are homotopic maps.   Cone   Let be a map of complexes. The cone of is the complex cone with cone and differential given by      There are different conventions for the sign in front of in the definition of the differentials on the cone of . Weibel [Wei94] defines and some authors even write    All of these choices do make our proposed differential a differential (check it!). The facts below about the mapping cone are all true up to sign whatever the sign convention we follow.   Let be a map of complexes. Show that giving a map of complexes cone is the same as giving a map of complexes , and a homotopy between and 0 .    Let be a map of complexes. Show that is nullhomotopic if and only of factors through the canonical map .    Given any map of complexes , there is a short exact sequence determined by the canonical arrows to and from the product coproduct. The connecting arrows from the Snake Lemma are exactly induced by , so there is a long exact sequence   As a consequence, is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if cone is exact.    Given a map of complexes , we can construct a double complex from , as follows:   Note that .   Now that we have introduced all the tools we need, the last thing we need is a technical but very useful lemma.  Acyclic Assembly Lemma   Let be a double complex in Mod.   If is an upper half plane double complex with exact rows, meaning whenever , then is exact.    If is a right half plane double complex with exact columns, meaning whenever , then is exact.    If is an upper half plane double complex with exact columns, meaning whenever , then is exact.    If is a right half plane double complex with exact rows, meaning whenever , then is exact.       Notice that and by switching the indexes. Moreover, we claim that it is sufficient to show , since it implies .  To show that implies , we need some notation. Given a double complex , consider the th truncation of defined by The natural inclusion induces an isomorphism in homology for .  Suppose that is a right half plane double complex with exact columns, and assume that holds. Then still has exact columns, so by c, is exact. On the other hand, notice that up to a vertical shift, is a first quadrant double complex, and for each fixed , there are only finitely many values of and with and such that . Therefore, , so is exact. We claim that this implies that is exact. One can make this precise by saying . The point is that any element , when we write explicitly as in terms of its coordinates in each , only finitely many are nonzero. Let be the smallest such that , and fix any . Then   So is exact, and b holds.  All we have left to do is to show c, meaning that the product total complex of any upper half plane double complex with exact columns is exact. We are going to show that , and the remaining homologies follow by shifting left and right. Consider a 0 -cycle in , meaning a sequence of elements for each such that . So   We will construct for each such that , proving that .  Set when . Since , we must have . We also assumed that the columns are exact, so in particular the 0th column is exact. We can then find such that , and thus .  Now we proceed by induction. Suppose we have constructed for with the desired property that for all . Then   The last equality comes simply from the fact that . So we have shown that . Since the columns are exact, we can find such that   Equivalently,      Given a double complex with for all , the horizontal differentials induce a map of complexes where denotes the double complex we obtain from by excluding the leftmost nonzero column, and , or equivalently, .    Balancing and    The balance of power is the scale of peace.   Thomas Paine   We are finally ready to show that the two definitions of coincide.  Balancing   Let and be -modules, and projective resolutions of and of . For all , there is an isomorphism     Consider and and the first quadrant double complex   Each and is projective and thus flat, by , so and are both exact functors. The rows and columns of our double complex are thus exact everywhere except for the 0th row and column. We can complete our double complex to make a double complex with both exact rows if we add in a column induced by the surjection :   We can also make a double complex with exact columns by adding in a row induced by :   By , and are both exact. Notice that is a map of complexes , and is a map of . By ,   Since and are both exact, by both are quasi-isomorphisms, so that     Balancing   Let and be -modules, and a projective resolution of and an injective resolution of . For all , there is an isomorphism     We have a surjection and an inclusion . The double cocomplex with and is a cohomological first quadrant double complex:   We proceed just like in , now considering two cohomological double complexes:   and   We obtained from by adding in a column induced by , and by adding in a row induced by . Now we notice that and   The dual of says that and are both exact, and thus and are both quasiisomorphisms. We conclude that     Module   Let be a ring and and be -modules. The th Tor module from to is     Notice in particular that the -module is defined only up to isomorphism.  Module   Let be a ring and and be -modules. The th Ext module from to is     Notice in particular that the -module is only defined up to isomorphism.   immediately gives us long exact sequences for Ext and Tor.  Long Exact Sequence of   Let be a ring and an -module. Every short exact sequence of modules induces a long exact sequence     Long Exact Sequence of   For every -module , every short exact sequence of -modules induces a natural long exact sequence and       Let and be -modules. For all , there are natural isomorphisms     Let be a projective resolution of . By , and . By , and are naturally isomorphic. In fact, determines an isomorphism. So consider the map which again are isomorphisms for all . Notice that these assemble into a map of complexes , since   Since all the are isomorphisms, is an isomorphism of complexes, and must then induce isomorphisms in homology. We conclude that     However, and can be dramatically different.   Let be a field and . The following is a minimal free resolution for :   To compute , we need only to apply to this resolution; one needs to be careful, though, as this is a contravariant functor. We obtain the following complex:   One can show that is multiplication by on ; moreover, we have a natural isomorphism , giving us   In particular,   In contrast, since is free. Thus .  There is an alternative description of Ext. It turns out that measures the extensions of by modulo split extensions. More precisely, an extension of by is a short exact sequence   We can put an abelian group structure on the set of isomorphism classes of extensions of by , using an operation called the Baer sum, and one can show that the resulting abelian group is isomorphic to . Via this description, the zero in corresponds to the split short exact sequence   The higher Ext modules can also be described in a similar fashion. First, we consider the set of -fold extensions of by , meaning short exact sequences of the form and the equivalence relation on this set given by the existence of a map of complexes   where the maps between the are not necessarily isomorphisms. We then define an operation on the set of equivalence classes of -fold extensions of by that is also called the Baer sum, and one shows that the resulting abelian group is isomorphic to .  Via this description, if and only if every short exact sequence splits.   Finally, here are some nice facts about Ext and Tor we leave as exercises.   If and are finitely generated -modules and is a noetherian ring, then and are both finitely generated -modules for all .    Let be a commutative ring and and be -modules. Consider the -module homomorphism given by multiplication by a fixed element .   Show that the map induced by is multiplication by on .    Show that is multiplication by on .    Show that the map induced by is multiplication by on .       Let be an -module.   Show that is flat if and only if for every -module .    Show that is projective if and only if for every -module .    Show that is injective if and only if for every -module .               "

This category -mod can be identified with the category of -modules, of modules over the (noncommutative) ring , the group ring of . It can also be identified with the functor category of functors from the category to the category of abelian groups. As a reminder, gives a category with one object and arrows the elements of .    (Co)Invariant Subgroup   The invariant subgroup  of a -module is   The coinvariant subgroup of a -module is      Given any -module and , where denotes the trivial -module. In fact, there are natural isomorphisms () and () .   Thus taking coinvariants is right exact, and taking invariants is left exact.  (Co)Homology Groups   Let be a group and a -module. The homology groups of with coefficients in are the -modules obtained via the left derived functors of the coinvariants functor:   Similarly, the cohomology groups of with coefficients in are the -modules obtained via the right derived functors of the invariants functor:     By Exercise 77,   Thus to compute group (co)homology we need a projective resolution for the trivial -module . Note also that by Proposition and .  Group (co)homology is a rich subject. For a detailed treatment of group (co)homology, see Weibel's Homological Algebra [Wei94].   Local Cohomology         -torsion Functor   Let be an ideal in a ring . The - torsion functor  -Mod -Mod is defined by which acts on maps by restriction.     The -torsion functor is a left exact covariant additive functor.   The -torsion functor gives rise to local cohomology, the right derived functors of . The th local cohomology of with support on is then given by   Local cohomology was introduced by Grothendieck in a series of seminars at Harvard in 1961, which are now very famous. Grothendieck himself never published any notes on the subject, but Robin Hartshorne's notes of those lectures have been published.  Local cohomology is a rich subject, and we could easily spend an entire semester on it. For a modern treatment of the local cohomology and its connections, the book 24 hours of local cohomology and the very nice notes by Craig Huneke, Mel Hochster, and Jack Jeffries are all excellent resources.  It turns out that local cohomology modules can be defined in a few different ways, which are in no way obviously equivalent, and those different points of view are quite helpful. For example, we can define local cohomology via the Čech complex.  Čech Complex   Let be an -module and . The Čech complex of on is given by   The Čech complex of on is given by      Let's compute the Čech complex on and and an -module .     a)   b) The maps between components corresponding to subsets are zero if , and \\pm 1 if .   It turns out that the cohomology of the Čech complex gives us local cohomology. For an ideal ,     so elements in the th local cohomology can be realized as equivalence classes of fractions.  Local cohomology modules also arise as a direct limit of Ext modules:     The equivalence between all these different definitions is a fundamental result in the theory of local cohomology.  Local cohomology modules play a crucial, ubiquitous role in commutative algebra. They measure many important invariants, such as dimension and depth, and are extremely useful tools for studying all sorts of topics; for example, they can be used to detect if a ring is Gorenstein (if it has finite injective dimension as a module over itself) or Cohen-Macaulay (a nice class of rings that is both very large but also very well behaved). However, local cohomology modules are typically not finitely generated. One reason for this is that injective modules are also often not finitely generated. Local cohomology is also a major reason why commutative algebraists are interested in studying injective modules.  In fact, local cohomology is almost never finitely generated. Here's a very simple example.  Example 6.40. Let be a field, and . Then has the -vector space structure     with -module structure given by     This is not a finitely generated module! Note also that every finitely generated submodule only has terms with bounded negative degree. But this is still a very nice module: it looks like upside down.       Despite being infinitely generated, local cohomology modules enjoy many finiteness properties we have gotten used to expecting from finitely generated modules. For example, over a local ring , the local cohomology modules of a finitely generated module are Artinian - but not Noetherian!  Huneke raised the question of whether local cohomology modules of noetherian rings always have finitely many associated primes, a problem which has been a very active research are in commutative algebra in the last few decades. While the answer to Huneke's question is no - as famous examples by Katzmann, Singh, and Singh and Swanson show - the local cohomology modules of finitely generated -modules over a regular ring do have finitely many associated primes.  One very important invariant we can study with local cohomology is the arithmetic rank.  Definition 6.41. Let be an ideal in a Noetherian . The arithmetic rank of is defined by     Given a variety , the arithmetic rank of its defining ideal is the minimum number of equations needed to define . It turns out that this number is difficult to study, and it is best understood via local cohomology, a thought best described by Lyubeznik:  Part of what makes the problem about the number of defining equations so interesting is that it can be very easily stated, yet a solution, in those rare cases when it is known, usually is highly nontrivial and involves a fascinating interplay of Algebra and Geometry.  The connection to local cohomology begins with the following two elementary facts about local cohomology:     Given any ideal for some -module .  So computing local cohomology modules, or deciding when they vanish, can help us find bounds on the arithmetic rank of a variety.  We close this chapter with yet another example of a derived functor of an interesting functor.  Exercise 80. Let be a domain and be its fraction field. Let denote the torsion functor.  a) Show that .  b) Show that for every short exact sequence     of -modules gives rise to an exact sequence     c) Show that the right derived functors of are and for all .

  "body": "What's an Abelian Category?  Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms  Monic and Epic      An arrow is a monomorphism or a mono if for all arrows     if then .    Similarly, an arrow is an epi or an epimorphism if for all arrows if then .       Here are some examples:  Monos and Epis     In , the monos coincide with the injective functions and the epis coincide with the surjective functions.    In , the monos coincide with the injective functions and the epis coincide with the surjective functions.    In any category, every isomorphism is both epi and mono.      Epi and Surjective not the Same  Show that the usual inclusion is an epi in the category .   This should feel weird: it says being epi and being surjective are not the same thing. Similarly, being monic and being injective are not the same thing.  Mono and Injective not the Same  Show that the canonical projection is a mono in the category of divisible abelian groups. An abelian group is divisible if for every and every positive integer there exists such that .    Monic and Epic in Poset Category  Show that given any poset , in the poset category of every morphism is both monic and epic, but no nonidentity morphism has a left or right inverse.   There are some special types of objects we will want to consider.  Initial and Terminal Objects   Let be a category. An initial object in is an object such that for every object in is a singleton, meaning there exists a unique arrow . A terminal object in is an object such that for every object in is a singleton, meaning there exists a unique arrow . A zero object in is an object that is both initial and terminal.    Uniqueness of Initial and Terminal Objects  Initial objects are unique up to unique isomorphism. Terminal objects are unique up to unique isomorphism.   So we can talk about the initial object, the terminal object, and the zero object, if they exist.  Initial and Terminal Objects     The empty set is initial in . Any singleton is terminal. Since the empty set and a singleton are not isomorphic in , there is no zero object in .    The module is the zero object in .    The trivial group is the zero object in .    In the category of rings, is the initial object, but there is no terminal object unless we allow the ring.    There are neither initial nor terminal objects in the category of fields.      Zero Arrow   Let be a category with a zero object . Given two objects and in , the zero arrow from to is the unique arrow that factors through , meaning the arrow given by composition of the unique arrows . We will often denote both the zero object and the zero arrow by , whenever it does not lead to confusion.     If a category has a zero object, then is always nonempty, since it contains at least the 0 arrow.    Composing the zero arrow with any other arrow always yields the zero arrow.    Additive Categories  An abelian category is a category that has just enough extra structure to behave like -Mod: we have complexes and exact sequences, homology, the Snake Lemma, the long exact sequence in homology, and many other nice features. On the one hand, every abelian category embeds nicely in some -Mod, so it is in some ways sufficient to study -Mod. In other ways, the general nonsense definitions in an abelian category can sometimes give us a uniform, simple way to prove many results about -Mod (and -Mod), and other related categories) all at once.  Preadditive Cateogory   A category is a preadditive category if:   For all objects and in is an abelian group.    For all objects , and in , the composition is bilinear, meaning        In the literature, preadditive categories are sometimes called Ab-enriched categories.   Our favorite category -Mod is a preadditive category; so is .   We can talk about additive functors between any two preadditive categories.    Let and be preadditive categories. An additive functor  is a functor such that the map is a homomorphism of abelian groups.     In any preadditive category with a zero object 0, the 0 arrow coincides with the 0 of the abelian .    We can characterize the zero object 0 by the property that the zero arrow and the identity arrows on 0 coincide. To see this, notice that if , then given any arrow , we must have and similarly any arrow must be 0. Then is terminal and initial, and it must be the zero object.   Additive Category   An additive category is a preadditive category such that:    has a zero object.     has all finite products: given any two objects and in , there exists a product of and in .         In an additive category, finite coproducts exist and they agree with products.    Let and be objects in our additive category, and consider their product, which exists by assumption:   The universal property of the product give arrows and such that   and   commute. We claim that together with and form a coproduct for and . Given an object and arrows and , we need to show that there exists a unique arrow such that   commutes.  To see such an exists, consider . Then so indeed our proposed does the job.  To show the uniqueness of such an , we will use the fact that together with and is a product for and . So suppose that is another arrow such that and . Then satisfies and , so it’s sufficient to show that the 0 arrow is the unique arrow such that   commutes. First, we claim that is the identity arrow on . And indeed, this map satisfies and so does the identity arrow , so the universal property of the product guarantees that . Now if and , then      Notation 7.11. In an additive category , given objects and , the notation denotes the product coproduct of and .    Remark 7.12. If is additive category, the object is characterized by the existence of arrows   such that      Lemma 7.13. Let an additive functor between additive categories, and let 0 denote the zero object on both categories.   We have . For any two objects and .    F preserves finite products and coproducts.       We show the statement assuming is covariant, and note that the argument in the contravariant case is essentially the same.   Since is a group homomorphism and that the zero elements in the abelian groups and are the corresponding zero arrows, then   Now the zero arrow and the identity arrows of the zero object coincide, and so do their images by . On the one hand, . On the other hand, by what we have shown at the arrow level we have   Then the identity and the zero arrows on coincide, so by Remark 7.8 we must have .    Fix objects and and the canonical arrows   Any functor preserves identity arrows, so any additive functor must satisfy which satisfy   By Remark 7.12, this implies that is the product coproduct of and .        Exercise 81. Let be an additive category.   Show that an arrow is a mono if and only if implies .    Show that an arrow is an epi if and only if implies .       Kernels and Cokernels  We can now define kernels and cokernels.    Let be an additive category and an arrow . The kernel of is an arrow satisfying the following properties:    is 0 .    Given any such that is the zero arrow, there exists a unique arrow such that , meaning that      commutes. We denote the kernel of by .     Remark 7.15. We claim that a kernel, if it exists, is always a mono. Indeed, suppose that are such that . Then , so it’s sufficient to show that implies . But then   commutes, and , so 0 factors uniquely through the kernel. But both and are such factorizations, so .   We are used to thinking about the kernel of a map as an object; but in this general context, the kernel is really an arrow, or more precisely, an object (the source of the kernel) and an arrow from that object to the source of . We sometimes refer to the kernel as the pair (object, arrow). Also, we might use the notation for the kernel of . W e might also abuse notation and refer to the object that is the source of as the kernel of , motivated by the familiar case of -Mod. Nevertheless, the kernel of is technically an arrow, not an object. A good reason for identifying the arrow ker with its source object is the following rewriting of the definition:   Remark 7.16. If and are both kernels of , then there exist unique arrows and such that   commutes. By Remark 7.15, kernels are always monic. But then , and since is a mono, we must have . Similarly, , and and are isomorphisms.  This shows that if is the kernel of , the object is, up to isomorphism, the unique object that satisfies the following universal property: for every object and every arrow such that , there exists a unique arrow such that .     Definition 7.17. Let be an additive category and . The cokernel of is an arrow , denoted coker , satisfying the following properties:      is 0.    Given any such that is 0 , there exists a unique arrow such that , meaning that      commutes.    We will sometimes use the notation coker for the cokernel of , although once again the cokernel of is an arrow rather than an object.  Example 7.18     The kernels and cokernels in -Mod are what we think they are: the inclusion of the usual kernel, and the projection onto the usual cokernel.    It’s not always true that all arrows have kernels or cokernels. For example, the category of finitely generated -modules over some nonnoetherian ring is additive, but it does not have all kernels. If is some infinitely generated ideal in , the kernel of the canonical projection does not exist in our category. In fact, this is an epi but not a cokernel: it should be the cokernel of the inclusion map , but that is not an arrow in our category.      While not all epis are cokernels and not all monos are kernels, the converse is true. Just like we saw for kernels, cokernels, if they exist, are always epi, and they are unique in the sense we described in Remark 7.16.  Exercise 82. Let be an additive category.   Show if is the cokernel of , the object is, up to isomorphism, the unique object that satisfies the following universal property: for every object and every arrow such that , there exists a unique arrow such that .    Show that every cokernel in is epi.      Remark 7.19. Let be an additive category, and let be any arrow such that ker coker and coker ker exist. Since , then by the universal property of the cokernel factors uniquely through coker( ), say by coker . Now   By Exercise 85, coker ker is an epi, and thus we must have coker . Then factors uniquely through ker coker , so we get a unique arrow such that   commutes.    Example 7.20. Let’s see what this factoring looks like in the more familiar example of -Mod. Given an -module homomorphism , we get a commutative diagram   The map is the isomorphism given by the First Isomorphism Theorem.    Definition of an Abelian Category  Abelian Category   Definition 7.21. An abelian category is an additive category such that   The category contains all kernels and cokernels of arrows in .    Every mono is a kernel of its cokernel.    Every epi is the cokernel of its kernel.    For every , the canonical arrow coker is an isomorphism.       Ultimately, an abelian category is one that has just enough structure so that we can extend many of the desired properties of -Mod. In particular, we will see that we can define complexes and their homology in any abelian category, and that the Snake Lemma and the long exact sequence in homology hold.   Remark 7.22. Let be an abelian category, and any arrow. As described in Remark 7.19, we have a commutative diagram   where is now assumed to be an iso. Now kernels are mono and cokernels are epi, by Exercise 85, and composing an epi (respectively, mono) with an iso gives us an epi (respectively, mono). Therefore, we can factor as a composition mono epi.    Example 7.23. In -Mod, this factorization is just the factoring through the image of the homomorphism: any -module homomorphism factors as      Definition 7.24. Let be an abelian category, and consider an arrow . The image of is .    Following Remark 7.22, the source of coker is the unique (up to unique isomorphism) object such that factors as   Exercise 83. Let be an abelian category.   Show that is a mono if and only if .    Show that is an epi if and only if .      Remark 7.25. If is an abelian category, its opposite category is also abelian. This is just a consequence of the fact that all the requirements to be an abelian category come together with the dual requirements, so everything automatically dualizes well.    Example 7.26. Here are some examples and nonexamples of abelian categories.   The category -Mod is an abelian category.    The category of free -modules is additive but not abelian, as kernels and cokernels do not exist in general.    The category of finitely generated -modules is abelian if and only if is noetherian, which is exactly the condition we need to guarantee the existence of kernels and cokernels. For a general (nonoetherian) ring , the category of noetherian -modules is abelian.    The category of Hilbert spaces with continuous linear functions is an additive category. The monos are injective linear maps, and the epis are maps with dense image. The kernels are the usual kernels, while the cokernel of is given by the orthogonal projection .  However, we claim that this is not an abelian category, since a mono might not be the kernel of its cokernel. Indeed, if is a dense inclusion that is not surjective, then this mono is not the kernel of its cokernel: its cokernel is but and thus , so ker coker , while .       Remark 7.27. Suppose that factors through , meaning that there exists such that   commutes. Then , so factors through , meaning we have another commutative diagram    Exercise 84. Show that the kernel of is the identity arrow , its cokernel is the identity arrow , and .  Exercise 85. Let be an abelian category, an epi, and a mono. Then , , and .   "

The functors are left exact.    We will show that is left exact. Notice that the contravariant functor can be viewed as the covariant functor . Since is also an abelian category, it will then follow that is also left exact, or equivalently, that is left exact.  So let be an exact sequence in . We want to show that is exact, and notice this last complex lives in the category of abelian groups.  We have three things to show:     Exactness at is equivalent to being a mono. By assumption, is a mono, so is injective.    Since , so is .    We want to show that , and these are now maps of abelian groups. So we need to show that every such that factors uniquely through , meaning . Our assumption that the original sequence is exact implies that . The universal of property of the kernel gives us that whenever must factor through .        Let be any small category. Show that if is an abelian category, then so is the category of functors .    The Yoneda Lemma: Revisited  We are now ready for the abelian category version of the Yoneda Lemma; this turns out to be a very useful result.  Yoneda Embedding for Abelian Categories   Let be an abelian category. Recall that denotes the category of contravariant functors . The covariant functor     is an embedding into a full subcategory. Moreover, this functor reflects exactness, meaning that if is exact, then must also be exact.    First, our functor is injective on objects because our axioms for a category include the assumption that the Hom-sets are all disjoint. Moreover, by the usual version of the Yoneda Lemma the assignment is a natural bijection. In particular, our functor is indeed full and faithful.  To show that the functor reflects exactness, suppose that is exact. Then , so .  It remains to show that . Let be the canonical arrow . The exactness of together with the fact that imply that factors through . By Remark 7.27, ker must also factor through , say by . The universal property of the kernels ker and will give us that and are inverse isos.  When -Mod, the proof can be simplified: the exactness of together with the natural isomorphism between and the identity functor give us that is exact.    Here is a fun and very useful application of Theorem 7.43.    Let be an adjoint pair of additive functors between abelian categories. Then is right exact, and is left exact.    Consider a short exact sequence in , and let be an object in . The adjointness of the pair gives us a commutative diagram   where the vertical maps are bijections of sets. For every in is left exact, by Theorem 7.42, so the bottom row of the diagram above is exact. We claim this implies that the top row must also be exact. Our vertical maps are a priori only bijection on sets, but it is easy to see that these natural bijections restrict to a bijection between the images of each pair of corresponding maps. Moreover, for any objects and , the natural bijection must always send 0 to 0, since   commutes. It is then routine to check that our bijections also restrict to bijections between the kernels of each pair of corresponding maps. The exactness of the bottom row then induces exactness of the top row. By Theorem 7.43, Hom reflects exactness, and we conclude that must also be exact. Thus is a left exact functor.  Finally, by Remark 7.25, and are both abelian categories. Consider the opposite functors and . Notice that is the right adjoint to , so must be left exact. Therefore, must be right exact.    This is possibly the first time we have encountered a proof that truly used duality in an essential and interesting way. In the case where -Mod, the fact that is left exact can be obtained using only methods from -Mod; but the statement about used the fact that is an abelian category, while the opposite category of -Mod is not another category of modules.  The Yoneda embedding from Theorem 7.43 is the first piece of the proof of a very important result.  Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem   Let be a small abelian category. There exists a ring , possibly not commutative, and an exact, fully faithful embedding -Mod.    The full details of the proof are rather complicated, and can be found in [Fre03]. Here is a very rough map of the proof. By Theorem 7.43, we already have a fully faithful embedding of in , so it is sufficient to show that there is a fully faithful embedding of into some -Mod. The idea is to quotient by an abelian subcategory that contains all the kernels and cokernels of the arrows for all epis , in such a way that the composite of the embedding in Theorem 7.43 with this quotient remains an embedding. Then one shows that this quotient category has all coproducts and also what is called a projective generator. Roughly speaking, this is a projective object such that for every object there exists an arrow . Then one shows that this implies that this category is equivalent to a full abelian subcategory of -Mod for some .   The Diagram Chasers: Revisited  Most of the theorems we have proved about -Mod extend to any abelian category. Some of those theorems can in fact be deduced from the fact that they are true over -Mod.  Snake Lemma   Consider an abelian category and a commutative diagram   If the rows of the diagram are exact, then there exists an exact sequence     Long exact sequence in homology   Given a short exact sequence in  there are connecting arrows such that is an exact sequence.    The Five Lemma   Given an abelian category , consider the following commutative diagram in with exact rows:   If and are epi and is a mono, then is an epi. If and are mono and a is epi, then is mono.    One can prove these by invoking the Freyd-Mitchell theorem and checking that one can go back and forth with our statements between some small subcategory of containing our diagram and all the necessary kernels, cokernels, etc, and some -Mod where that category embeds. Alternatively, one can use what are called members, as in [ML98, VIII.4.5]. The theory of members is an attempt to fix the main difficulty when dealing with abelian categories: that the objects and arrows are not just sets and functions, so we can’t just talk about members of the objects and their images by each arrow.

Definition 7.49. Let be an abelian category. An object in is projective if is an exact functor. An object in is injective if is exact.    This generalizes the notion of projective and injective modules.   Remark 7.50. Let be an abelian category. An object is projective if and only if every arrow factors through every epi :   and an object is injective if and only if every arrow factors through every mono :     Exercise 93. Let be an abelian category.  a) Show that .  b) Show that if and are projective, then so is .     Definition 7.51. An abelian category has enough projectives if for every object there exists a projective object and an epi . We say that has enough injectives if for every object there exists an injective object and a mono .    Lemma 4.13 and Theorem 4.31 say that -Mod has enough injectives and enough projectives.   Example 7.52. The category of finite abelian groups has no projectives beside 0. In particular, Ab does not have enough projectives.   Projective Resolution   Definition 7.53. Let be an object in the abelian category . A projective resolution of is a complex where all the are projective, , and for all . An injective resolution of is a cochain complex such that every is injective, for all , and .      Theorem 7.54. If has enough projectives, every object in has a projective resolution. Similarly, if has enough injectives, every object in has an injective resolution.    Proof. Given be an object in , let’s construct a projective resolution explicitly. We start by picking an epi from a projective . Since is an epi, it is the cokernel of its kernel, so is a short exact sequence. Now we find an epi , and set to be the composition   We proceed the same way, at each step taking a projective and an epi , and setting to be the composition . By construction, , where is an epi and ker is mono. By Exercise 85, im .    This generalizes Theorem 5.2 in a natural way, and the proof is essentially the same.   Split Exact Sequences: Revisited  We can also characterize injectives in term of split short exact sequences, as we did for modules. In particular, the Splitting Lemma extends to any abelian category.    Definition 7.55. Let be an abelian category. A short exact sequence     splits if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:    There exists an arrow such that .    There exists an arrow such that .    There exists an isomorphism of complexes between our sequence and       where the arrows are the canonical arrows that come with the (co)product .      Theorem 7.56. Let be an abelian category. Every short exact sequence     where is injective or is projective splits.    The proofs are exactly the same as in the case of -Mod, Theorem 4.6 and Theorem 4.32. Proof. If is projective, there exists such that   commutes, so and is a splitting. If is injective, there exists such that   commutes, so , and is a splitting.  More generally, we can talk about split exact complexes.    Definition 7.57. A complex in is split if there are arrows such that the differential satisfies . A complex is split exact if it is both exact and split.     Remark 7.58. A split short exact sequence is precisely a short exact sequence that is a split complex.    Exercise 94. Additive functors preserve split complexes, meaning that if is a split complex, then so is for any additive functor . In particular, additive functors preserve split short exact sequences.    Unique Resolutions and the Horseshoe Lemma: Revisited    Lemma 7.59. Let be an abelian category, in with each projective, an arrow in such that and a projective resolution of . Given any in , there exists a map of complexes such that   commutes, which is unique up to homotopy.    Proof. Since is projective and is an epi, there exists such that   commutes.  We proceed inductively, assuming we have with . Since is projective, there exists such that   commutes. Commutativity gives , so factors through the kernel of .   Since is a projective resolution of , the arrow above is an epi, so the arrow we just constructed factors through , giving us such that   commutes.  Now suppose we are given two such maps of complexes and lifting , say and . Note that and 0 are two liftings of the 0 map. We are going to show that any map lifting the 0 map must be nullhomotopic, which will then imply that and are homotopic as well (essentially via the same homotopy!).  So let be a map of complexes lifting the 0 map .   We will construct a nullhomotopy for inductively. Set for all . The commutativity of the rightmost square says that , so . Since factors through . But is an epi and is projective, there exists such that   commutes. So satisfies . Set .  Now suppose we have constructed such that . Then     so . Therefore, factors through , and since is a projective resolution of is an epi. Therefore, the factorization of through also factors through , and we end up with an arrow such that   commutes. This must then satisfy , and ultimately is a homotopy between and 0 .      Theorem 7.60 (Horseshoe Lemma). Let be an abelian category, be a projective resolution of , and be a projective resolution of . If     is an exact sequence, there exists a projective resolution of and maps of complexes and lifting and such that     is an exact sequence in .    First, a word on notation: denotes the coproduct in , and given arrows and , we will write for the unique arrow induced by and . Moreover, we will denote the differential of by , and the differential of by .  Set . Recall that the product and coproduct in coincide, by Lemma 7.10, so let and be the canonical arrows. One can show that in fact we get short exact sequences     for all . Moreover, is projective for all , by Exercise 93. We will construct the missing differentials inductively.  Since is projective and is an epi, there exists such that   commutes. Set . The universal property of the coproduct guarantees that   commutes. By the Five Lemma, is epi. By the Snake Lemma, is exact. We then proceed by induction, and at each step we apply the base case to   where the vertical arrows are epi because and are projective resolutions and thus exact.     By duality, if has enough injectives,     is exact, and and are injective resolutions for and , then there exist an injective resolution of and a short exact sequence of complexes     extending the given one.

  "body": "What is a Spectral Sequence?  It has been suggested that the name \"spectral\" was given because, like spectres, spectral sequences are terrifying, evil, and dangerous. I have heard no one disagree with this interpretation, which is perhaps not surprising since I just made it up.  (Ravi Vakil, in Spectral Sequences: friend or foe?)  Spectral sequences are useful bookkeeping tools for computing, among other things, the homology and cohomology of complicated complexes. Unfortunately, spectral sequences have a bad reputation for being difficult and scary; but continuing Vakil’s quote above, \"you can use spectral sequences without hesitation or fear, and [...] you shouldn’t be frightened when they come up in a seminar\". Rotman wisely says that \"Of course, the reader must digest these new ideas in order to apply them, but it is worth the effort\" [Rot09, page 608].  Spectral sequences were introduced independently by Leray and Lyndon in the 1940s. Leray came up with the idea while he was a prisoner of the nazis during WWII. The primary usages of spectral sequences are in homotopy theory and topology more generally, but there are also applications in commutative algebra and other fields. Due to its topological roots, the subject is best learned with a topological backdrop - which provides many motivating examples - but since we are not assuming any particular topological background, we will give only a very brief introduction to the subject, and from a more algebraic perspective.  Here are some recommended sources to learn more about spectral sequences:    Rotman’s book An introduction to Homological Algebra (second edition) [Rot09].    John McCleary’s A user’s guide to spectral sequences [McC01].    Ravi Vakil’s notes Spectral Sequences: friend or foe?    Hatcher’s additional chapter on spectral sequences, an addition to his Algebraic Topology book [Hat02].    Weibel’s book An introduction to homological algebra [Wei94].    Eisenbud’s Appendix A3.13 to his book Commutative algebra with a view towards algebraic geometry [Eis95].    Mel Hochster’s notes.    Michael Hutchings notes.    Roughly speaking, a spectral sequence is a book where each page is a plane with a module (or more general, an object in an abelian category) sitting in each point with integer coordinates. To pass the pages, we take the (co)homology of a differential, and attach to the next page a new differential with a different shape.  Definition 8.1. A cohomological spectral sequence consists of the following data:    A family of -modules ranging over all integers with . For a fixed , the collection of modules is called the th page or sheet of the spectral sequence. We think of each page as living in , and depict the th page by putting in the point with coordinates :       Differentials       so -module homomorphisms such that , or more precisely,       Isomorphisms       meaning     for every .

A filtration on is a family of submodules of such that either     for all , in which case we say the filtration is increasing, or     for all , in which case we say the filtration is decreasing. When we do not specify if a filtration is ascending or descending, we will assume by default that it is ascending, though we accept both kinds as filtrations in their own right. The factors of are the quotient modules     One can in fact define filtrations on any abelian category; that requires the notion of a subobject, which we have not yet defined, but it is easy to guess: a suboject of an object in an abelian category is a mono with target . In particular, we can define a filtration on a complex, or more generally on a (differential) (bi)graded module:  Definition 8.20. An ascending filtration on a (bi)graded module is a sequence of submodules of such that . If is a differential (bi)graded module, we require additionally that the filtration respects the differential, that is, that .  So in particular when is a complex, we get the following definition:  Definition 8.21. Let be a complex. An ascending filtration of is an ascending chain of subcomplexes of      We call a complex with a filtration a filtered complex, and denote it by .

Let be a complex and consider an ascending filtration of . For each fixed homological degree , we get an ascending filtration     of submodules of . A filtration of gives us commutative diagrams   where the rows are given by the differential on and its restrictions to the appropriate modules.  Definition 8.23.

A filtration of a graded module is bounded if for each there exists integers and such that     so that the filtration on can be described by finitely many terms     In particular, for all and for all .

Definition 8.28. We can filter the integers as a -module as follows: we set     and     This give us the decreasing filtration     The corresponding associated graded module has     and     Remark 8.29 (the associated graded versus the actual module). Suppose someone has filtered the -module by , but that we only have access to the associated graded module of this filtration. While the pieces of the associated graded give us information about , they may not be sufficient to fully compute . For a simple example, consider an -module and a submodule , and the filtration     The associated graded is given by     So if we are only given the associated graded, meaning, if all we have access to is and , then all we know about is that fits into a short exact sequence     However, if , then this does not uniquely determine .

For now, let us stick to cohomological spectral sequences; any general statement we make about these can easily be translate into a statement about homological spectral sequences.  Definition 8.30. We say that a spectral sequence is bounded if for every there are only finitely many nonzero terms of total degree , meaning that there are only finitely many pairs with such that for all .  Remark 8.31. Notice that if a spectral sequence is bounded, then for every there exists an such that all the differentials in and out of are zero, and thus .  Most spectral sequences one deals with end up being bounded, so we will focus only on the case of bounded spectral sequences. This guarantees that what we are about to do makes sense.  From the data in a spectral sequence we define a limiting page , which can often be identified with some interesting object (for example, the homology of a complex we care about). These pages are sort of the whole point of the spectral sequence business, as they contain (pieces of) the information we want to compute.  Construction 8.32 ( page). Set     so that .

This is by design; to give a good example of a spectral sequence we need to do a bit more work than to give a starting example for a run of the mill definition. In the next few sections we will discuss some of the ways in which spectral sequences arise. There are, however, many interesting spectral sequences one would discuss in a first course that we do not have the time to cover.

Given a filtered complex , we first, define     and let be the differential induced on the associated graded . Each column of the page contains a complex, one of the levels of the filtration.   Next, let     and note that     Thus and are consistent with being the zeroeth and first pages of a spectral sequence. Before we move on, note that we can also rewrite the page as follows:     One way to interpret this is that if we take an element representing the class such that , then the element is really in , so we really should move it to the column on our left (the one indexed by ).  Thus the differential on is the map defined as follows: since each class corresponds to an element such that , we recast by asking about its class in . If , that means , and so on. Ultimately, we will gather information about how deep into our filtration we can go to still find .  Inspired by this, we define     Now given representing a class , by definition     so we define     We claim that this is well-defined, and leave the details as an exercise. Moreover, since .

Example 8.40. Consider any short exact sequence of complexes, which we can always write as the inclusion of a subcomplex into a complex followed by the quotient map:     It turns out that we can recover the long exact sequence in homology given by the Snake Lemma via a spectral sequence.  To do that, we can think of the inclusion as a filtration on : we set     Let us compute the spectral sequence of this filtered complex. First, note that In page, we have     The differential on the page is induced by the differential on and . Note that we denote the differential on both complexes and by the same letter since the differential on is just the restriction of the differential on . So the page looks like   where only the 0th and first columns are nonzero.  The page is obtained by taking homology, so it looks like     and the differentials , which are now horizontal, are induced by . More precisely, we can rewrite the terms on the right column as     and so by definition any class is represented by some such that . Since , then , and so we can ask about the class of in . So the differential on is given by     Now onto the page, where     and     Note now that is a map of degree , and thus , since we always have zero as the source or target (or both) of .

So for all we get isomorphisms     and     So we now have all the tools we need to construct the long exact sequence in homology from this spectral sequence. First, we construct a complex. Our map from the spectral sequence gives us homomorphisms     By definition, ; composing this with the map consists of viewing and asking for its class in . But , so the composition     is zero.  Similarly, the map takes a class , represented by  , and identifies with its image in . But by definition, so and the composition     is the zero map.

On the one hand, the fact that this is a complex says that     but our spectral sequence gave us the isomorphism     so by the First Isomorphism Theorem we get     We can now conclude that . This gives us exactness at . Similarly, we claim that the fact that we have a complex gives us a map     Indeed, for any we get , and the map is well-defined since if then by definition , so that we get a well-defined map from . But our spectral sequence gave us an isomorphism     so that the map we defined above is an isomorphism, and thus we must have     proving exactness at . Finally, this also says that we can rewrite our previous isomorphism as     but by the First Isomorphism Theorem we get     We already knew that from the fact that we had a complex, so we conclude that we must have exactness at .  Thus we have recovered the connecting homomorphism from the Snake Lemma and the long exact sequence in homology, all via this spectral sequence.  "

We know exactly how each spectral sequence converges to : via the filtration on induced by the given filtration on . More precisely,     Remark 8.47. If is a first quadrant double complex, so that whenever or , then for all we have     Thus     Moreover, for each fixed if we take or then     so     Thus each fixed diagonal of and contains the factors of a finite filtration on :     In the special case when or collapses, meaning that is concentrated in one row or column, then the filtration on has a unique term in each degree, so that we can read exactly from the page.  Remark 8.48. The fact that can lead to a lot of confusion. To make things easier, one often breaks the rules a little and instead takes the page to be with horizontal differentials, the page to have vertical differentials induced by the vertical differentials on , and then the page to have a differential of degree . This gives us a gadget that isn’t quite a spectral sequence under our formal definition, but should be a spectral sequence. In fact, this new convention makes everything much easier to read.  Under this reasonable convention, the differentials look as follows:   0th page   1st page   2nd page  Also, note that now     and that while     we now should carefully read the filtration backwards:     Example 8.49. Let us give a new proof of the Snake Lemma using spectral sequences. More precisely, we will show that given any commutative diagram with exact rows   then there exists an exact sequence     To do that, we start by viewing our commutative diagram as a double complex , as follows: we set , and so on, resulting in   Now notice that is a first quadrant double complex with exact rows, so by the Acyclic Assembly Lemma, is exact. We can also prove that is exact by computing the spectral sequence arising from the Second Filtration on , which under our new and improved notation from Remark 8.48 has     and since the rows are all exact, we see that in the next step we will end up with , and thus . Therefore, .  Now consider the spectral sequence induced by the First Filtration on , which has   Now whatever is, since is a degree map, the only possible nonzero differential on is . Moreover, all the differentials on all the higher pages vanish, simply because there are not enough nonzero modules already, so . But we know that is exact, so in fact since our filtrations are finite we must necessarily have . In particular, the only potentially nonzero objects in are and , so this proves the exactness of   Moreover, the fact that and are the only possible nonzero objects in together with the fact that and imply that must be an isomorphism.

  "body": "Generated Modules    True success comes only when every generation continues to develop the next generation.   John C. Maxwell   In many ways, commutative algebra is the study of finitely generated modules. While vector spaces make for a great first example of modules, many of the basic facts we are used to from linear algebra are often a little more subtle in commutative algebra. These differences are features, not bugs. The first big noticeable difference between vector spaces and general modules is that while every vector space has a basis, most modules do not.  Generated Module  basis free module generating set generators for an -module   Let be an -module and . The submodule of  generated by (also known as the submodule spanned by) , denoted , is the smallest (with respect to containment) submodule of containing . module generated by a subset   We say  generates  , or is a set of generators for , if , meaning that every element in can be written as a finite linear combination of elements in .    Basis   A subset of an -module is a basis of , if the set generates and is linearly independent. generating set  set of generators  basis of a module     Free Module   An -module M is a free  -module if admits at least one a basis. free module     Vector Space is a Free Module  Every vector space over a field is a free -module.   Free -module Isomorphic to Copies of   Every free -module is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of .    To construct such an isomorphism for the free -module , take a basis for and let be a map such that The condition that is a basis for is equivalent to being an isomorphism of -modules.    One of the key things that makes commutative algebra so rich and beautiful is that most modules are in fact not free. In general, every -module has a generating set --- for example, itself. Given some generating set for , we can always write a presentation presentation  EMPTY  for , but in general will have a nontrivial kernel. A nonzero kernel element corresponds to a relation between the generators. relation   Homomorphism Determined of Images of Elements   A homomorphism of -modules is completely determined by the images of the elements on any given set of generators for .    Generated Module Equivalencies   The following are equivalent:     generates as an -module.  Every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of the elements of with coefficients in .  The homomorphism , where is a free -module with basis in bijection with via , is surjective.         (1 2) Suppose generates as an -module. The definition of a generated submodule is that it is the smallest submodule containing all linear combinations of the generators of . Thus every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of elements of .  (2 3) Suppose every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of the elements of with coefficients in , and let be defined as above. Let . Thus can be written in the form , where and and . As is in bijection with , we see that there exist such that for each . Thus the element maps to via .    (3 1) Suppose the homomorphism , where is a free -module with basis in bijection with via , is surjective. Thus for any there exists some such that . As is a basis for there exist such that . As is a homomorphism, we see that where each and each . Thus every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of elements of with coefficients in .        The equivalence between (1) and (2) in says that the submodule generated by is exactly the set of all finite linear combinations of elements in with coefficients in , which explains the notation .   Finitely Generated Module   We say that a module is finitely generated if we can find a finite generating set for finitely generated module      A better name might be finitely generatable , since we do not need to know an actual finite set of generators to say that a module is finitely generated.     An -module is cyclic if it can be generated by one element. cyclic module Equivalently, we can write as a quotient of by some ideal .    Indeed, given a generator for , the kernel of the map induced by is some ideal . Since we assumed that generates , is automatically surjective, and thus induces an isomorphism .     More generally, if an -module has generators, we can naturally think about it as a quotient of by the submodule of relations among those generators. More precisely, if is generated by , then the homomorphism of -modules that sends each of the canonical generators of to is surjective; more precisely, this is a presentation for . presentation By the , .   Macaulay 2  Defining free modules in Macaulay2 is straightforward:   i1 : R = QQ[x,y,z]; i2 : M = R^3 3 o2 = R o2 : R-module, free  Note that from now on and until we reset Macaulay2, whenever you write R it will be read as a ring, not a module; if instead you want to refer to the module , you can write it as R^1 . Alternatively, you can also use the command module and write module R . If you do calculations that require a module and not a ring, it is important to be careful about whether you write R or R^1 ; this is an easy way to get an error message.  If we want to define a module that happens to be an ideal, but we want to think about it as a module, we can use the command module to turn the ideal into a module:   i3 : I = ideal\"xy,yz\" o3 = ideal (x*y, y*z) o3 : Ideal of R i4 : N = module I o4 = image | xy yz | 1 o4 : R-module, submodule of R  If we forget that this is actually an ideal, and simply think about as a submodule of the module , we can also view this module as the image of a map, as we described in : if a submodule of has generators, we can view it as the the image of the map that sends each of the canonical generators of to the generators we chose for our module. In our example, our module is the image of the following map from to :   i5 : phi = map(R^1,R^2,{{x*y,y*z}}) o5 = | xy yz | 1 2 o5 : Matrix R <--- R i6 : L = image phi o6 = image | xy yz | 1 o6 : R-module, submodule of R  Note that above, when we first defined the module , Macaulay2 immediately stored that information in this exact way, as the image of the same map we just defined. This is useful to keep in mind when you see the results for a computation: if a module is given to us as the image of a matrix, then we are being told that our module is a submodule of some free module. If the matrix has rows, then that means our module is a submodule of . Each column corresponds to a generator of our module (as a submodule of ).  Of course that the modules , , and we have defined are all the same module: the ideal . It is our job to know that; depending on how you ask the question, Macaulay2 might not be able to identify this. Finally, we can also describe this module by saying that it has two generators, say and , and there is a unique relation between them: This means that our module is the quotient of by the submodule generated by the relation . We can write this as the quotient of by the image of a map landing in , meaning it is the cokernel of a map.   i7 : psi = map(R^2,R^1,{{-z},{y}}) o7 = | -z | | y | 2 1 o7 : Matrix R <--- R i8 : K = coker psi o8 = cokernel | -z | | y | 2 o8 : R-module, quotient of R  When a module is given to us in this format, as the cokernel of some matrix, we are essentially being given a presentation: the number of rows is the number of generators, while each column corresponds to a relation among those generators. If one the vector appears in a column of the matrix, that means that the generators satisfy the relation Keep in mind that when you do a calculation and the result is a module given to you in this format, Macaulay2 will not necessarily respond with a minimal presentation: one of the generators given might actually be a linear combination of the remaining ones, so there might be more generators than necessary, and there might be superfluous relations which follow as linear combinations of the others. You might be able to get rid of some superfluous generators and relations using the command prune . We will discuss this in more detail when we talk about local rings in .   "

The -algebra generated by a subset of , denoted , is the smallest (with respect to containment) subring of containing and . A set of elements  generates  as an -algebra if .    Note that there are two different meanings for the notation for a ring and set : one calls for a polynomial ring, and the other calls for a subring of something.

This can be unpackaged more concretely in a number of equivalent ways.  Generated Algebra Equivalencies   The following are equivalent:    generates as an -algebra.

But as we have discussed, any -algebra can be thought of as a quotient of a polynomial ring over . For example, the Veronese algebra is a quotient of a polynomial ring over in variables, since it has algebra generators.

Algebra Finite iff Quotient of Polynomial Ring  From the discussion above, we conclude that is a finitely generated -algebra if and only if is a quotient of some polynomial ring over in finitely many variables.  If is generated over by , we will use the notation to denote . Of course, for this notation to properly specify a ring, we need to understand how these generators behave under the operations; this is no problem if and are understood to be contained in some larger ring.   Jacobian Determinant and Generation   There are many basic questions about algebra generators that are surprisingly difficult. Let and . When do generate over ?

Noetherian rings are named after Emmy Noether, who is in many ways the mother of modern commutative algebra.  Noetherian Ring  noetherian ring   Suppose is a commutative ring. Then is called a noetherian ring if satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals - i.e., for every chain of ideals of  there exists a positive integer such that for all .     Equivalent Noetherian Ring Definitions   Let be a ring. The following are equivalent:    is a noetherian ring.  Every nonempty family of ideals has a maximal element (under ).  Every ascending chain of finitely generated ideals of stabilizes.  Given any generating set for an ideal , is generated by a finite subset of .  Every ideal of is finitely generated.     (1) (2): Suppose there is a nonempty family of ideals with no maximal element. This means that we can keep inductively choosing larger ideals from this family to obtain an infinite properly ascending chain, so is not noetherian.  (2) (1): An ascending chain of ideals is a family of ideals, and the maximal ideal in the family indicates where our chain stabilizes.  (1) (3): Contained within the definition of a noetherian ring.  (3) (4): Suppose that there is an ideal and a generating set for such that no finite subset of generates . So for any finite we have , so there is some Thus, . Inductively, we can continue this process to obtain an infinite proper chain of finitely generated ideals, so (c) does not hold.  (4) (5): This is the definition of being finitely generated.  (5) (1): Given an ascending chain of ideals let . In general, the union of two ideals might fail to be an ideal, but the union of a chain of ideals is an ideal (exercise). By assumption, the ideal is finitely generated, say . Now since each is in , it must be in some , by definition. Thus for any , we have . But then , and thus for all . Thus the original chain stabilizes, and is noetherian.     When we say that every non-empty family of ideals has a maximal element, that maximal element does not have to be unique in any way. An ideal is maximal in the family if for some implies . However, we might have many incomparable maximal elements in . For example, every element in the family of ideals in given by is maximal.    If is a noetherian ring and is a non-empty set of ideals in , not only does have a maximal element, but every element in must be contained in a maximal element of . Given an element , the subset of of ideals in that contain is nonempty, and must then contain a maximal element by . If for some , then , so , and thus by maximality of in , we must . This proves that is in fact a maximal element in , and by construction it contains .   Examples of Noetherian Domains      If is a field, the only ideals in are and , so is a noetherian ring.     is a noetherian ring, since all ideals are principal. More generally, if is a PID, then is noetherian. Indeed, every ideal is finitely generated!    As a special case of the previous example, consider the ring of germs of complex analytic functions near ,  This ring is a PID: every ideal is of the form , since any can be written as for some , and any such is a unit in .    A ring that is not noetherian is a polynomial ring in infinitely many variables over a field , : the ascending chain of ideals does not stabilize.    The ring is not noetherian. A nice ascending chain of ideals is     The ring of continuous real-valued functions  is not noetherian. The chain of ideals is increasing and proper. The same construction shows that the ring of infinitely differentiable real functions  is not noetherian: properness of the chain follows from, e.g., Urysohn's lemma (though it's not too hard to find functions distinguishing the ideals in the chain). Note that if we asked for analytic functions instead of infinitely-differentiable functions, every element of the chain would be the zero ideal!        Quotient Noetherian   Let be a ring and an ideal in . If is noetherian, then so is .    There is an order preserving bijection that sends the ideal to ; its inverse is the map that sends each ideal in to its preimage. Given this bijection, chains of ideals in come from chains of ideals in that contain . This implies that if is noetherian, then is noetherian as well.    This gives us many more examples of noetherian rings, by simply taking quotients of the examples above. We will soon show that any polynomial ring over a noetherian ring is also noetherian; as a consequence, we obtain that any quotient of a polynomial ring over a field is noetherian. This is the content of Hilbert's Basis Theorem.  But first, we need to talk about noetherian modules.    Noetherian Modules  Noetherian Module  noetherian module   An -module is noetherian if every ascending chain of submodules of eventually stabilizes.     Equivalent Definitions for Noetherian Module   Let be an -module. The following are equivalent:    is a noetherian module.    Every nonempty family of submodules has a maximal element.    Every ascending chain of finitely generated submodules of eventually stabilizes.    Given any generating set for a submodule , the submodule is generated by a finite subset of .    Every submodule of is finitely generated. In particular, a noetherian module must be finitely generated.        Noetherian Ring iff Noetherian Module over Itself   A ring is a noetherian ring if and only if is noetherian as a module over itself.     Noeth Ring Not Noeth Mod over Subring   A noetherian ring need not be a noetherian module over a subring.    For example, consider . These are both noetherian rings but is not a noetherian -module; for example, the following is an ascending chain of submodules which does not stabilize:      Noetherianity in Exact Sequences   In an exact sequence of modules is noetherian if and only if and are noetherian.    Assume is noetherian. Since is a submodule of , and its submodules are also submodules of , is noetherian. Moreover, any submodule of is of the form for some submodule of . Since every submodule of is finitely generated, every submodule of is also finitely generated. Therefore, is noetherian.  Conversely, assume that and are noetherian, and let be a chain of submodules of . First, note that is an ascending chain of submodules of , and thus it stabilizes. Moreover, is a chain of submodules of , and thus it also stabilizes. Pick a large enough index such that both of these chains stabilize. We claim that , so that the original chain stabilizes as well. To show that, take . Then so we can choose some such that . Then . Now note that , so , and thus Then , and since , we must have as well.     Direct Sums are Noetherian   If and are noetherian -modules, then is a noetherian -module.    Apply the previous to the short exact sequence      Module Powers are Noetherian   A module is noetherian if and only if is noetherian for some . In particular, if is a noetherian ring then is a noetherian module.    We will do induction on . The case is a tautology. For , consider the short exact sequence  and the inductive hypothesis give the desired conclusion.     Submodule of F.G. Module F.G   Let be a noetherian ring. Given an -module , is a noetherian -module if and only if is finitely generated. Consequently, any submodule of a finitely generated -module is also finitely generated.    If is noetherian, is finitely generated, and so are all of its submodules.  Now let be noetherian and be a finitely generated -module. Then is isomorphic to a quotient of for some , which is noetherian by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Corollary - Module Powers are Noetherian|Corollary]] and [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Quotient Noetherian|Lemma]].     Noetherian Required for Noetherian F.G   If is a non-noetherian ring and is a finitely generated -module, might not be noetherian.    For a dramatic example, note that itself is a finitely generated -module, but not noetherian.      Hilbert's Basis Theorem  Now we are ready to prove Hilbert's Basis Theorem. David Hilbert was a big influence in the early years of commutative algebra, in many different ways. Emmy Noether's early work in algebra was in part inspired by some of his work, and he later invited her to join the Göttingen Math Department — many of her amazing contributions to algebra happened during her time in Göttingen. Unfortunately, some of the faculty opposed a woman joining the department, and for her first two years in Göttingen, Noether did not have an official position nor was she paid. Hilbert's contributions also include three of the most fundamental results in commutative algebra — Hilbert's Basis Theorem, the Hilbert Syzygy Theorem, and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.   Hilbert's Basis Theorem   If is a noetherian ring, then the polynomial rings and are noetherian for any .    We will give the proof for polynomial rings, and at the end we will indicate what the difference is in the argument for the power series ring case. First, note that by induction on , we can reduce to the case .  Given an ideal , consider the set of leading coefficients of all polynomials in , By the [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Exercise - Hilbert Basis Lemma|Hilbert Basis Lemma]], we see that this is an ideal of . Since is noetherian, is finitely generated, so let . Pick such that the leading coefficient of is , and set .  Let . The leading coefficient of is an -linear combination of . If has degree greater than , then we can cancel off the leading term of by subtracting a suitable combination of the . Therefore, any can be written as for some and with degree at most . In particular, note that Since is a submodule of the finitely generated free -module , it must also be finitely generated as an -module. Given such a generating set, say , we can write any element as an -linear combination of these generators and the original . Therefore, is finitely generated as an ideal in , and is a noetherian ring.  In the power series case, take to be the set of coefficients of lowest degree terms.     We can rephrase in a way that can be better understood by those with high school algebra (as opposed to abstract algebra) knowledge:   Any system of polynomial equations in finitely many variables can be written in terms of finitely many equations.    Finally, note that a standard corollary of the Hilbert Basis Theorem is that finitely generated algebras over noetherian rings are also noetherian.   F.G. Algebras over Noeth Rings are Noeth   If is a noetherian ring, then any finitely generated -algebra is noetherian. In particular, any finitely generated algebra over a field is noetherian.    Any finitely generated -algebra is isomorphic to a quotient of a polynomial ring over in finitely many variables; polynomial rings over noetherian rings are noetherian by the , and quotients of noetherian rings are noetherian.     The converse to this statement is false: there are lots of noetherian rings that are not finitely generated algebras over a field. For example, is not algebra-finite over . We will see more examples of these when we talk about local rings.   Finally, we can now prove a technical sounding result that puts together all our finiteness conditions in a useful way.   Artin-Tate Lemma   Let be rings. Assume that    is noetherian,     is module-finite over , and     is algebra-finite over . Then, is algebra-finite over .       Let and . Then, for some . Let . This is a finitely generated -algebra; by this [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Corollary - F.G. Algebras over Noeth Rings and Noeth|Corollary]], since is noetherian, so is .  We claim that . Given an element , write as a polynomial expression in . Since the are linear combinations of the with coefficients in the we have . Then using the equations for repeatedly, we can rewrite as a linear combination of the with coefficients in .  Since is noetherian and is a finitely generated -module, is a noetherian -module, by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Proposition - Submodule of F.G. Module F.G.|Proposition]]. Since , then is also a finitely generated -module. In particular, is algebra-finite. Since is algebra-finite, we conclude that is algebra-finite, as required.     "

  "body": "Graded Rings        When we think of a polynomial ring , we often think of with its graded structure, even if we have never formalized what that means. Other rings we have seen also have a graded structure, and this structure is actually very powerful.  Graded Ring   Let be a monoid; in many examples we will take , which is a monoid since we follow the convention that is a natural number. A ring is - graded  -graded -graded graded ring if we can write a direct sum decomposition of as an abelian group indexed by , such that This means that for all and , we have .    Homogeneous Element   An element in one of the summands of is said to be homogeneous  homogeneous element of degree  degree of homogeneous element  ; we write  or  to denote the degree of a homogeneous element .    Homogeneous Component   By definition, an element in a graded ring is a unique sum of homogeneous elements, which we call its homogeneous  homogeneous components  graded components or graded components . One nice thing about graded rings is that many properties can usually be checked on homogeneous elements, and these are often easier to deal with.    Graded Ring Properties   Let be a -graded ring.     is homogeneous of degree (the identity of ).   is a subring of .  Each is an -module.        Write with homogeneous of degree . Then implies for . Similarly, for any other we have , and thus (here is where we use the cancellative assumption). Thus for , so     We have shown that . Moreover, is a subgroup under addition, and implies .    By assumption, is a subgroup under addition. Given and we must have .      Graded Ring Examples     Any ring is trivially an -graded ring, by setting and for .    If is a field and is a polynomial ring, there is an -grading on called the standard grading  standard grading where is the -vector space with basis given by the monomials of total degree , meaning those of the form with . For example, is homogeneous in the standard grading, while is not.    If is a field, and is a polynomial ring, we can give different -gradings on by fixing some tuple and letting be a homogeneous element of degree ; we call this a grading with weights  weights  . For example, in , is not homogeneous in the standard grading, but it is homogeneous of degree under the -grading with weights .    A polynomial ring also admits a natural -grading: the grading with . This is called the fine grading  fine grading     Let be a subsemigroup of . Then is an -graded subring of with the fine grading. Moreover, every -graded subring of is of this form.      Macaulay2  Polynomial rings in Macaulay2 are graded with the standard grading by default. To define a different grading, we give Macaulay2 a list with the grading of each of the variables:  i1 : R = ZZ\/101[a,b,c,Degrees=>{{1,2},{2,1},{1,0}}];  We can check whether an element of  isHomogeneous , and the function degree applied to an element of returns the least upper bound of the degrees of its monomials:  i2 : degree (a+b) o2 = {2, 2} o2 : List i3 : isHomogeneous(a+b) o3 = false    You may have seen the term homogeneous polynomial used to refer to a polynomial that satisfies for all and some fixed . This is equivalent to saying that all the terms in have the same total degree , or that is homogeneous with respect to the standard grading.  Similarly, a polynomial is quasi-homogeneous , quasi-homogenous polynomial or weighted homogeneous or , if there exist integers such that the sum is the same for all monomials appearing in . So satisfies for all and is homogeneous (in the previous sense, so with respect to the standard grading).  This condition is equivalent to asking that be homogeneous with respect to some weighted grading on .    Quasi-Homogeneous  In , the element is not homogeneous in the standard grading, but it is homogeneous (of degree 30) if we set , , and . This tells us that is quasi-homogeneous; it is homogeneous with respect to the weights . Indeed,     Homogeneous Ideal   An ideal in a graded ring is called homogeneous  homogenous ideal if it can be generated by homogeneous elements.     Equivalent Homogeneous Ideal Definitions   Let be an ideal in a graded ring . The following are equivalent:    is homogeneous.    For any element we have if and only if every homogeneous component of lies in .     , where .         (1) (2): Let be homogeneous generators for . If , we can write as We can also write each as a sum of its components, say . Then, after substituting and collecting, expresses as a sum of homogeneous elements of different degrees, so     (2) (1): Any element of is a sum of its homogeneous components. Thus, in this case, the set of homogeneous elements in is a generating set for .    (1) (3): As above, is generated by the collection of additive subgroups in this case; the sum is direct as there is no nontrivial -linear combination of elements of different degrees.    (3) (2): We can take generators for each abelian group , and the collection of all of them is a generating set for .        Given an -graded ring , then is a homogeneous ideal.   We now observe the following:   Quotients of Graded Rings   Let be an -graded ring, and be a homogeneous ideal. Then has a natural -graded structure induced by the -graded structure on .    The ideal decomposes as the direct sum of its graded components, so we can write It's elementary to check that this direct sum decomposition satisfies the desired properties.     Homogeneous Ideals    The ideal in is homogeneous with respect to the standard grading on , and thus the ring admits an -grading with .  The ring does not admit a grading with , but by it does admit a grading with .      Graded Module   Let be a -graded ring and an -module. An -module is - graded  -graded module graded module if there exists a direct sum decomposition of as an abelian group indexed by : for all .    The notions of homogeneous element of a module and degree of a homogeneous element of a module take the obvious meanings. A notable abuse of notation: we will often talk about -graded modules over -graded rings, and likewise.   Graded Ring Homomorphism   Let and be -graded rings with the same grading monoid . A ring homomorphism is graded or degree-preserving  graded ring homomorphism  degree preserving homomorphism if for all .     Note that our definition of ring homomorphism requires , and thus it does not make sense to talk about graded ring homomorphisms of degree . But we can have graded module homomorphisms of any degree.    Graded Module Homomorphism   Let and be -graded modules over the -graded ring . A homomorphism of -modules] is graded  graded homomorphism of degree  degree of a graded module homomorphism  if for all . A graded homomorphism of degree is also called degree-preserving  degree-preserving homomorphism .     Shift    Consider the ring map given by .

Given , the homomorphism of -modules given by is degree preserving. However, if instead we take for some , then the map is not degree preserving, although it is a graded map of degree . We can make this a degree-preserving map if we shift the grading on by defining to be the -module but with the -grading given by . With this grading, the component of degree of is . Now the map is degree preserving.     "

We can think of the process of localization at as zooming in at the prime .

We can consider this as the ring of rational functions that in lowest terms have a denominator with nonzero constant term.

Canonical Localization Map and Injectivity   As a consequence of , it follows that if is a domain, then the canonical map is always injective for any multiplicatively closed set , since every nonzero has .

Induced Localization Module Homomorphism   If is an -module homomorphism, then there is a -module homomorphism given by the rule .

Then, In particular, if is prime,     Localization is Exact   Given a short exact sequence of -modules and a multiplicative set , the sequence is also exact.    Localization Preserves Inclusions   It follows from this [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Zero in Localization|Lemma]] that if is injective, then is also injective, since So this explains some of [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Localization is Exact|Theorem]], since it shows that localization preserves inclusions.

Strict Containment in Ass SES   If is a module with at least two associated primes, and is an associated prime of , then is exact, but .

If and are -graded, there exists a prime filtration of where the quotients are graded modules, the are homogeneous primes, and .

In the graded case, if is the annihilator of an element of degree , we have a degree-preserving map sending the class of to .    Building Prime Filtration  Let's build a prime filtration for the module , where and . With a little help from Macaulay2, we find that  i4 : associatedPrimes M o4 = {ideal (y, x), ideal (z, x)} o4 : List  So our first goal is to find such that or . Let’s start from . To find such an element, we can start by searching for all the elements killed by :  i5 : I : ideal\"x,z\" 2 o5 = ideal (y*z, x*y, x ) o5 : Ideal of R  Now and are both in , so the submodule of generated by is precisely the set of elements killed by . Is ?  i6 : ann ((I + ideal(x*y))\/I) o6 = ideal (z, x) o6 : Ideal of R  Yes, it is! So our prime filtration starts with where our computations so far show that . For step , we start from scratch, and compute the associated primes of :  i7 : associatedPrimes (R^1\/(I + ideal\"xy\")) o7 = {ideal (y, x), ideal (z, x)} o7 : List  Unfortunately, we will again have to find another element killed by . So we repeat the process:  i8 : (I + ideal\"xy\") : ideal\"x,z\" 2 o8 = ideal (y, x ) o8 : Ideal of R i9 : ann((I + ideal\"y\")\/(I + ideal\"xy\")) o9 = ideal (z, x) o9 : Ideal of R  So in , , so we can take the submodule generated by for our next step, so our prime filtration for now looks like So now we repeat the process with :  i10 : associatedPrimes (R^1\/(I + ideal\"y\")) o10 = {ideal (y, x)} o10 : List i11 : (I + ideal\"y\") : ideal\"x,y\" o11 = ideal (y, x) o11 : Ideal of R i12 : ann((I + ideal\"x\")\/(I + ideal\"y\")) o12 = ideal (y, x) o12 : Ideal of R  This gives us Next, we take and find that  i13 : associatedPrimes (R^1\/(I + ideal\"x,y\")) o13 = {ideal (y, x)} o13 : List i14 : (I + ideal\"x,y\") : ideal\"x,y\" o14 = ideal 1 o14 : Ideal of R  This last computation actually says we are done: since kills everything inside , we can now complete our prime filtration with   The prime ideals that appear in this filtration are and . From the computation in the beginning, these are precisely the associated primes of .   Ass Finite   If is a noetherian ring, and is a finitely generated module, and is a prime filtration of with , then Therefore, is finite. Moreover, if is graded, then is a finite set of homogeneous primes.    For each , we have a short exact sequence By , . Inductively, we have , and . This immediately implies that is finite. In the graded case, gives us a filtration where all the are homogeneous primes, and those include all the associated primes.    Prime Ideals are Ass(M) for some M   Any subset (for any ) can be realized as for some module : take . However, is not finitely generated when is infinite.    Let be a subset of . We construct an -module such that .  Let and consider the -module . Then for any prime ideal , we have if and only if . Thus, we have .  It remains to show that is an ideal in .

First, observe that any element of can be written as a unit times for some , so any associated prime of must be the annihilator of for some . However, we claim that these are never prime. Indeed, we have , which is not prime since but .    Associated Primes Localize in Noetherian Rings   Let be a noetherian ring, a multiplicative set, and a module.

Now suppose that is associated to . By [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Localization Ideals|Lemma]], we know this is of the form for some prime in such that . Since is noetherian, is finitely generated, say in , and so .  By assumption, for some , . Since is a unit in , we can also write . By definition, this means that for each Let . Then for all , and thus . We claim that in fact in . Consider . Then , and since , this implies that . Therefore, , and for some . But , and thus . Thus .

Sarah Dessen    We refine our decomposition theory once again, and introduce primary decompositions of ideals. One of the fundamental classical results in commutative algebra is the fact that every ideal in any noetherian ring has a primary decomposition. This can be thought of as a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:   Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic   Every nonzero integer can be written as a product of primes: there are distinct prime integers and integers such that Moreover, such a a product is unique up to sign and the order of the factors.     We will soon discover that such a product a primary decomposition, perhaps after some light rewriting. But before we get to the and the of primary decomposition, it is worth discussing the . If we wanted to extend the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to other rings, our first attempt might involve irreducible elements. Unfortunately, we don't have to go far to find rings where we write elements as a unique product of irreducibles up to multiplying by a unit.    In , are two ways to write as a product of irreducible elements. In fact, we cannot obtain or by multiplying or by a unit.   Primary Ideal   We say that an ideal is primary primary ideal if We say that an ideal is - primary -primary ideal , where is prime, if is primary and .    Radical of Primary Ideal is Prime   The radical of a primary ideal is prime.    Suppose that is primary and . Then for some . If , then . Since is primary, we must have , so .    Prime Ideals are Primary   Any prime ideal is also primary.    Principal Primary Ideals in UFDs   If is a UFD, we claim that a principal ideal is primary if and only if it is generated by a power of a prime element.    Indeed, if , with irreducible, then Conversely, if is not a prime power, then , for some , nonunits with no common factor, then take but and .    Primary Ideals in   The nonzero primary ideals in are of the form for some prime and some . This example is a bit misleading, as it suggests that primary ideals are the same as powers of primes. We will soon see that it not the case.    Primary in   In , the ideal is primary.    Give the grading with weights and . If , then has a degree zero term. If , then has a term of degree zero or one. The product has a term of degree zero or one, so is not in .    Not Primary in   In , the ideal is not primary, even though is prime.    The offending product is : we have and .     One thing that can be confusing about primary ideals is that the definition is not symmetric. For to be a primary ideal, given a product , the definition says that if , then , and it also says that if , then . In , we found that and , so is not primary. Notice that if we switch the roles of and , we do have , but that is not sufficient to make a primary ideal.   Characterization of Primary Ideals   If is noetherian, the following are equivalent: (a) is primary. (b) Every zerodivisor in is nilpotent on . (c) is a singleton. (d) has exactly one minimal prime, and no embedded primes. (e) is prime and for all with , . (f) is prime, and .     : Saying is a zerodivisor modulo if there is some with . So the condition that every zerodivisor on must be nilpotent is equivalent to This is exactly the condition that is a primary ideal.   : First, note that the associated primes of are the associated primes of the ideal , while the minimal primes of are the minimal primes of . By [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Zerodivisors Associated Primes|Theorem]], Every minimal prime of is associated to , so Finally, every nilpotent element is always a zerodivisor. Putting all these together, we always have the following: On the one hand, (2) says that the set of zerodivisors on coincides with the elements in the nilradical of ; thus (2) is the statement that we have equality throughout. So (2) holds if and only if The rest of the proof is elementary set theory: the intersection and union of a collection of sets agree if and only if there is only one set. More precisely, we have equality above if and only if there is only one associated prime.   is clear, given that every ideal has a minimal prime and minimal primes are always associated, so having a single associated prime means having only one minimal prime and no embedded primes.   : Given the observation that the radical of a primary ideal is prime, this is just a rewording of the definition.   : By [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Localization Ideals|Lemma]], we have the following characterization: Thus the second condition in is equivalent to .    Radical Max Implies Primary   Let be a noetherian ring and be an ideal. If a maximal ideal, then is a primary ideal.    By [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Support and Associated Primes|Theorem]], is nonempty and contained in , so , and hence by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Characterization of Primary Ideals|Proposition]] is primary.     Note that the assumption that is maximal was necessary here. Indeed, having a prime radical does not guarantee an ideal is primary, as we saw [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Exercise - Not Primary in |here]]. Moreover, even the powers of a prime ideal may fail to be primary.   Powers of Prime not Primary   Fix a field and an integer , and let . Consider the prime ideal in . On the one hand, , while and . Therefore, is not primary, even though its radical is the prime .    Contraction of Primary Ideals is Primary   Let be a ring homomorphism. If is a primary ideal in , then is a primary ideal in .    if , and , then , so for some . Therefore, , and is indeed primary.    Ass Intersection   If are ideals, then     The canonical map sending has kernel , so there is an inclusion . Hence, by and , The statement for larger follows by an easy induction.    Intersections Primary   A finite intersection of -primary ideals is -primary.    Let be -primary ideals. Then by , On the other hand, By , is nonempty, and thus . Then is -primary by the characterization of primary in (3) above.    Primary Decomposition   A primary decomposition primary decompostion irredundant primary decompostion of an ideal is an expression of the form with each primary. A primary decomposition is irredundant if      By , the intersection of -primary ideals is -primary. Thus we can turn any primary decomposition into an irredundant one by combining the terms with the same radical, then removing redundant terms.   Primary decomposition in  Given a decomposition of as a product of distinct primes, say , then the primary decomposition of the ideal is . However, this example can be deceiving, in that it suggests that primary ideals are just powers of primes; as we saw in , powers of primes may fail to be primary! Moreover, an ideal might be primary but not a power of a prime.    The existence of primary decompositions was first shown by Emanuel Lasker (yes, the chess champion!) for polynomial rings and power series rings in 1905, and then extended to any noetherian ring (which were not called that yet at the time) by Emmy Noether in 1921.   Lasker, 1905, Noether, 1921   Every ideal in a noetherian ring admits a primary decomposition.    We will say that an ideal is irreducible irreducible ideal if it cannot be written as a proper intersection of larger ideals. If is noetherian, we claim that any ideal of can be expressed as a finite intersection of irreducible ideals. If the set of ideals that are not a finite intersection of irreducibles were nonempty, then by noetherianity there would be an ideal maximal with the property of not being an intersection of irreducible ideals. Such a maximal element must be an intersection of two larger ideals, each of which are finite intersections of irreducibles, giving a contradiction.  We claim that every irreducible ideal is primary. If we show this, any decomposition into an intersection of irreducible ideals will be a primary decomposition. To prove the contrapositive, suppose that is not primary, and take with , . The ascending chain of ideals stabilizes for some , since is moetherian. Note that this means that for any element , we have . Using this, we will show that proving that is not irreducible. The containment is clear. On the other hand, if we can write for some , and So By definition, this means that , and thus . This shows that is not irreducible, concluding the proof.    Irredundant Decompositions for   Let , where is a field, and . We can write These are two different irredundant primary decompositions of .    To check this, we just need to see that each of the ideals and are primary. Observe that each has radical , which is maximal, so these ideals are both primary. In fact, our ideal has infinitely many minimal primary decompositions: given any , is an irredundant primary decomposition. One thing all of these have in common is the radicals of the primary components: they are always and .    1st Uniqueness Theorem for Primary Decompositions   Suppose is an ideal in a noetherian ring . Given any irredundant primary decomposition of , say we have In particular, this set is the same for all irredundant primary decompositions of .    For any primary decomposition, irredundant or not, by we have We just need to show that in an irredundant decomposition as above, every is indeed an associated prime of . So fix , and let Since the decomposition is irredundant, the module is nonzero. By , has an associated prime, say . Fix such that is the annihilator of in for some . Since we conclude that . Since is the unique minimal prime of and is a prime containing , we must have . On the other hand, for any , we have , and since , we must have by the definition of primary ideal. Thus , so we can now conclude that . This shows that is an associated prime of for all . But this is a submodule of , and thus is associated to .     2nd Uniqueness Theorem for Primary Decompositions   If is an ideal in a noetherian ring , then the minimal components in any irredundant primary decomposition of are unique. More precisely, if is an irredundant primary decomposition, and , then is given by the formula which does not depend on our choice of irredundant decomposition.    Let be a primary ideal, and let be any prime. If , then . Since the associated primes of an ideal localize well, by , will still have a unique associated prime. Thus, the localization is either: - the unit ideal, if , or - a primary ideal, if . Finite intersections commute with localization, by , so for any prime , is a primary decomposition, although not necessarily irredundant. Fix a minimal prime of , and let . When we localize at , all the other components become the unit ideal, since their radicals are not contained in , and thus . We can then contract to to get , since is -primary and we can then apply (6).     If is not noetherian, we may or may not have a primary decomposition for a given ideal. It is true that if an ideal in a general ring has a primary decomposition, then the primes occurring are the same in any irredundant decomposition. However, they are not the associated primes of in general; rather, they are the primes that occur as radicals of annihilators of elements.   Decomposition of Radical Ideal is Unique  If is noetherian, and is a radical ideal, then we have seen that coincides with the intersection of its minimal primes , meaning . This is the only primary decomposition of a radical ideal.  For a more concrete example, take the ideal in . This ideal is radical, so we just need to find its minimal primes. And indeed, one can check that . More generally, the radical monomial ideals are precisely those that are squarefree, and the primary components of a monomial ideal are also monomial.   Decomposition of in Unique  Let's get back to our motivating example in , where some elements can be written as products of irreducible elements in more than one way. For example, we saw that So , but while is primary, is not. In fact, has two distinct minimal primes, and the following is a minimal primary decomposition for : In fact, all of these come components are minimal, and so this primary decomposition is unique. Primary decomposition saves the day!   Symbolic Power   If is a prime ideal in a ring , the  symbolic power symbolic power of is .    Characterizations of Symbolic Powers   Let be noetherian, and a prime ideal of . (a) . (b) is the unique smallest -primary ideal containing . (c) is the -primary component in any minimal primary decomposition of .    The first characterization follows from the definition, and the fact that expanding and contraction to\/from a localization is equivalent to saturating with respect to the multiplicative set, which we proved in .  We know that is -primary from one of the characterizations of primary we gave in . Any -primary ideal satisfies , and if , then . Thus, is the unique smallest -primary ideal containing .  The last characterization follows from the second uniqueness theorem, .      In , the prime satisfies for all . This follows along the same lines as .  In , where , we have seen in Example that the square of is not primary, and therefore . Indeed, , and , so but .  Let be a matrix of indeterminates, and be a polynomial ring over a field~ . Let be the ideal generated by minors of . Write for the determinant of the submatrix with rows and columns . We find Note that in the second row, we subtracted the Laplace expansion of the determinant of the matrix with row 3 replaced by another copy of row 1. That is, we subtracted zero.     While we will not discuss symbolic powers in detail, they are ubiquitous in commutative algebra. They show up as tools to prove various important theorems of different flavors, and they are also interesting objects in their own right. In particular, symbolic powers can be interpreted from a geometric perspective, via the Zariski-Nagata Theorem. Roughly, this theorem says that when we consider symbolic powers of prime ideals over , the polynomials in are precisely the polynomials that vanish on the variety corresponding to . This result can be made sense of more generally, for any radical ideal in over any perfect field , and even when .   "

We will say that an ideal is irreducible irreducible ideal if it cannot be written as a proper intersection of larger ideals. If is noetherian, we claim that any ideal of can be expressed as a finite intersection of irreducible ideals. If the set of ideals that are not a finite intersection of irreducibles were nonempty, then by noetherianity there would be an ideal maximal with the property of not being an intersection of irreducible ideals. Such a maximal element must be an intersection of two larger ideals, each of which are finite intersections of irreducibles, giving a contradiction.  We claim that every irreducible ideal is primary. If we show this, any decomposition into an intersection of irreducible ideals will be a primary decomposition. To prove the contrapositive, suppose that is not primary, and take with , . The ascending chain of ideals stabilizes for some , since is moetherian. Note that this means that for any element , we have . Using this, we will show that proving that is not irreducible.

Confucius   In field theory, there is a close relationship between (vector space-)finite field extensions and algebraic equations. The situation for rings is similar, but much more subtle.  Integral Element   Let be a ring, an -algebra, and an ideal. An element of is integral over if it satisfies an equation of the form An element of is integral over if In both cases, we say that and satisfy an equation of integral dependence over     FIX   Integral automatically implies algebraic, but the condition that there exists an equation of algebraic dependence that is monic is stronger in the setting of rings. This is very different to what happens over fields, where algebraic and integral are equivalent conditions.   Integral in   Consider the -algebra . The element is integral over     since it satisfies the equation of integral dependence .    in Not Integral in   Prove is not integral over     If are such that then multiplying by gives which is impossible for parity reasons (the left hand-side is odd!). Notice, in contrast, that is algebraic over , since it satisfies .    Integrally Closed   Consider an an inclusion of rings . The integral closure  integral closure of in is the set of elements in that are integral over . We say is integrally closed  integrally closed in if is its own integral closure in . The integral closure of a domain in its field of fractions is usually denoted by     Normal Domain   A normal domain is a domain that is integrally closed in its field of fractions, meaning     Integers are a Normal Domain   The ring of integers is a integrally closed, meaning its integral closure in its fraction field is itself. The key idea to show this is similar to the argument we used is not integral over .    In fact, this is a special case of the fact that every UFD is normal.  UFDs are Normal   Show that every UFD is normal.     We cannot talk about the integral closure of a ring without specifying in what extension; the integral closures of in different extension can be very different. In , we saw that the integral closure of in contains at least and , while says that the integral closure of in is .  When is a domain, if we ever refer to the integral closure of , it is understood that we mean the integral closure of in its field of fractions, .    An element is integral over if and only if is integral over the subring , so we might as well assume that is injective.   F.G.-by-Intl-Modfin   Consider a ring extension .   If is integral over , then is module-finite over .    If are integral over , then is module-finite over .         Let be integral over , with for some . We claim that . Since is generated by all the powers of as an -module, to show that any polynomial is in it is enough to show that for all .    Using induction on , the base cases follow from the fact that is contained in the -th component. For the induction step, we need to show that for all ; we can do this by induction because we can use the equation above to rewrite as which is a linear combination of powers of of degree up to .    Write Since is integral over , it is also integral over , via the same monic equation that satisfies over . By Part (a), we conclude that the each extension is module-finite. Thus the inclusion is a composition of module-finite maps, and thus by this [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Compositions Preserve Module Finite|Lemma]] it is also module-finite.      In what follows, we will need the following elementary linear algebra fact, which is actually very useful in various contexts within commutative algebra. In fact, later in this class we will use this useful fact again, perhaps when you least expect it. This is a nice example of an algebra fact that holds over any ring that we can actually reduce to the case of fields.  Classical Adjoint   The classical adjoint of an matrix is the matrix with entries where  is the matrix obtained from by deleting its th row and th column. classical adjoint    Determinantal Technique  determinantal technique   Let be a ring, , , and . (a) . (b) If , then .     When is a field, this is a basic linear algebra fact. We will deduce the case of a general ring from the field case. The ring is a -algebra, so we can write as a quotient of some polynomial ring . Let be a surjection, be such that and let . Note that since is a homomorphism, and the entries are the same polynomial functions of the entries of the matrices and , respectively. Thus, it suffices to establish in the case when , and we can do this entry by entry. Now, is an integral domain, hence a subring of a field (its fraction field). Since both sides of the equation live in and are equal in the fraction field (by linear algebra) they are equal in . This holds for all , and thus 1) holds.  By assumption, we have , so by part 1)      Module Finite Implies Integral   Let be module-finite. Then is integral over .    Given , we want to show that is integral over . The idea is to show that multiplication by , realized as a linear transformation over , satisfies the characteristic polynomial of that linear transformation.  Suppose that . We may assume that , perhaps by adding a module generator. Since every element in is an -linear combination of , this is in particular true for the elements . Thus we can find such that for each . Consider the matrix and the column vector . We can now write the equalities above more compactly as . By the Determinantal Technique, . Since we chose one of the entries of to be , we have in particular that . Expanding this determinant as a polynomial in , this is a monic equation with coefficients in .    We are now ready to show the following important characterization of module-finite extensions, which tells us exactly what we need besides algebra-finite to force an extension to be module-finite:  Mod Fin iff Integral and Alg Fin   An -algebra is module-finite over if and only if is integral and algebra-finite over .    ( ): Module-finite implies integral, and algebra-finite.  ( ): If is integral over , then each is integral over , and this implies is module-finite over .    Extensions Gen by Integral Elements are Integral   If is generated as an algebra over by integral elements, then is integral over .    Let , with integral over for all . Given , there is a finite subset such that . This is now a finitely-generated algebra generated by integral elements, and thus it must be module-finite over . Module-finite implies integral, and thus is an integral extension of . In particular, is integral over .    Integral Elements form Subring   Given any ring extension , the set of elements of that are integral over form a subring of .    By the -subalgebra of generated by all elements in that are integral over is integral over , so it is contained in the set of all elements that are integral over : this means that so equality holds throughout, and is a ring contained in by definition.    In other words, the integral closure of in is a subring of containing .   Integral Over      The ring , where is not a perfect square, is integral over . Indeed, satisfies the monic polynomial , and since the integral closure of is a ring containing and , and is the smallest such ring, we conclude that every element in is integral over .    Let . Then we claim that is module-finite over To see this we first need to realize as a subring of . To do that, consider the -algebra homomorphism The kernel of consists of the polynomials in and that are multiples of , but any nonzero multiple of in must have -degree at least , which implies it involves and thus it is not in . We conclude that is injective, and thus   Now is generated over as an algebra by one element, , and satisfies the monic equation , so is integral over .       Note, however, that not all integral extensions are module-finite.   Integral but Not Algebra or Module Finite   Let be a field, and consider the -algebra given by Note that satisfies the monic polynomial , and thus it is integral over . Since is generated by elements that are integral over , by it must be an integral extension of . However, is not algebra-finite, and thus it is also not module-finite.     Tower Integral iff Each Piece Integral   Given ring extensions , the extensions and are integral if and only if is integral.    Finally, here is a useful fact about integral extensions that we will use multiple times.   Int Ext Domains Field   If is an integral extension of domains, then is a field if and only if is a field.    Suppose that is a field, and let be a nonzero element, which is necessarily integral over . The ring is algebra-finite over by construction, and integral over . Since is integral and algebra-finite, it must also be module-finite. Since is a field, this means that is a finite-dimensional vector space over . Since is a domain, the map is injective. Notice that this is a map of finite-dimensional -vector spaces, and thus it must also be surjective. In particular, there exists an element such that and thus is invertible. We conclude that must be a field.  Now suppose that is a field, and let . Since , there exists an inverse for in , which must be integral over . Given any equation of integral dependence for over , say with , we can multiply by to obtain Therefore, is invertible in , and is a field.    Before we move on from algebra-finite and module-finite extensions, we should remark on what the situation looks like over fields. First, note that over a field, module-finite just means finite dimensional vector space. While over a general ring the notions of algebra-finite and module-finite are quite different, they are actually equivalent over a field. This is a very deep fact, and we will unfortunately skip its proof — since it is a key ingredient in proving a fundamental result in algebraic geometry, we will leave it for the algebraic geometry class next semester. This is a nice application of the Artin-Tate Lemma, which we are going to discuss shortly, together with some facts about transcendent elements.   Zariski's Lemma   A field extension is algebra-finite if and only if it is module-finite.    The following corollary follows immediately from what we proved in this section:   Alg-Fin Ext of Alg Closed Field   Let be an algebraically closed field. If the field extension is algebra-finite, then .    By Zariski's Lemma, must be module-finite, making the extension integral. When we are over a field, integral is the same as algebraic, but integrally closed fields have no nontrivial algebraic extensions.    "

Given a ring homomorphism , we want to study the behavior of chains of primes: how chains in behave under expansion to and how chains in behave under contraction to .

The map on spectra induced by can be identified with the inclusion of into . For the second map, , we saw in that the map on spectra can be identified with the inclusion of the set of primes that do not intersect , i.e., those whose contraction is contained in .

Direct Summand and Surj Spec Map   If is a direct summand, the map is surjective.    By , we know for all ideals in this case, so says the map on Spec is surjective.

We can write these equations in the form , where , and . By the determinantal trick, , we have . Since we can assume , we have . The fact that this is the type of equation we want follows from the monomial expansion of the determinant: any monomial is a product of terms where some of them are copies of , and the rest are elements of . Since this is a product of terms, a term in has a coefficient coming from a product of elements of .  So this shows that . Now notice that is immediate from the definition, as noted in .

Therefore, if is a prime in , by we have , and Then , and by we conclude that is in the image of the map on Spec.     Both assumptions that the extension is integral and that it is an inclusion are needed in [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Lying Over|Lying Over]]; we cannot reduce to the case of an integral inclusion. The point is that being an inclusion does not translate into a property of the induced map on Spec.    We saw in that the map induced on Spec by the inclusion is not surjective. So does not apply — indeed, this inclusion is not module-finite, and thus by it is not integral. For example, the infinite set is a minimal generating set for over .    Suppose is a regular element on , but not a unit. Since is regular, the map is an inclusion, but we claim it is not integral. If is integral over , there would be such that After multiplying by all terms are of the form , and thus in , since the localization map is injective. So and must be a unit. So whenever is a regular element but not a unit, is an example of an inclusion that is not integral. Note that the image of the map on Spec is the complement of , so in particular the map is not surjective.  In contrast, the map is integral, since it is module-finite, but it is not an inclusion. The map on Spec is again not surjective: its image is .    Let be an ideal in . Suppose is an integral extension. There is an induced map , and that map is integral: an equation of integral dependance for over gives an equation for integral dependance of its class in over .   Integral Extension Maximal Contracts to Maximal   If is integral, is maximal if and only if is maximal in .    By , the induced map is an integral extension of domains, and (respectively, ) is maximal if and only if (respectively, ) is a field. So this follows by .    Integral Preserved by Localization   Let be integral, and let be a multiplicatively closed subset of . Then is integral.    Since is a multiplicatively closed subset of , its image in is also multiplicatively closed. Given and , then we have equations of the form Thus is integral over , and is integral over .    Incomparability  Incomparability   If is integral and are primes in that satisfy , then .    In this case we can reduce to the case of an inclusion: factors through , and the map induced on Spec factors as Since the map on spectra induced by is injective, we can replace by the quotient and assume is an integral inclusion.  So suppose is integral, and let . By , localizing at preserves integrality.  By localizing at , the image of is a maximal ideal. So we can reduce to the situation where is a maximal ideal. By , are both maximal ideals. Therefore, .    Finite Contractions in Int Noeth Alg   Let be an integral -algebra. If is noetherian, then only finitely many primes contract to each .    If contracts to , then , so in particular contains some prime minimal over . Then so . By , . So all the primes contracting to are in , which is a finite set since is noetherian, by .

Going Up  Going Up Theorem   If is integral, then for every in and with , there is some with and .    Consider the map . This is integral, as we observed in . It is also injective, so applies. Thus, there is a prime of that contracts to the prime in . We can write for some , and we must have that contracts to .    Integral Dim Equality   If is integral, then .    We have already shown that in , so we just need to show that . Fix a chain of primes in . By Lying Over, , there is a prime contracting to . Then by Going up, , we have with . Continuing, we can build a chain of distinct primes in of length . So , and equality follows.    Lemma Minimal Polynomial   Let be a integrally closed and let be an element in some larger domain that is integral over . Let be the fraction field of , and be the minimal polynomial of over . (a) If is integral over , then . (b) If is integral over a prime , then has all of its nonleading coefficients in .    Let be integral over . Fix an algebraic closure of containing , and let , be the roots of . Since divides any polynomial with coefficients in that satisfies, it also divides a monic equation of integral dependance for over . Therefore, each is a solution to such an equation of integral dependence, and thus must be integral over .  Let . This is a module-finite extension of , so all of its elements are integral over . The leading coefficient of is 1, and the remaining coefficients of are polynomials in the , hence they lie in . On the other hand, is normal, so . We conclude that all the coefficients of are in , and .  Now let be integral over . By the same argument as above, all of the are integral over . Since each , any polynomial in the lies in . So the nonleading coefficients of lie in , by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Lying Over|Lying Over]].    Going Down  Going Down Theorem   Suppose that is a integrally closed, is a domain, and is integral. Then, for every in and in with , there is some with and .    Let be the multiplicative set in consisting of products of elements in and . Note that each of the sets and contains , so and are both contained in . We will show that is empty. Once we do that, it will follow from that there is a prime ideal in containing such that is empty. Since , our new prime must necessarily be contained in .  Moreover, , so is empty, or equivalently, . Since and , we conclude that .  So our goal is to show that is empty. We proceed by contradiction, and assume there is some . We can write for some and . Moreover, since , is integral over , by .  Consider the minimal polynomial of over , say By , each . Then substituting in and dividing by yields We claim that this is the minimal polynomial of . If satisfied a monic polynomial of degree , multiplying by would give us a polynomial of degree that satisfies, which is impossible. So indeed, this is the minimal polynomial of .  Since , and thus integral over , says that each . Since and , we must have . The equation then shows that . Since contains and hence , we have . This is the desired contradiction, since by construction.    Height in Normal Domains   If is a integrally closed, is a domain, and is integral, then for any .    We already know from that . To show that , given a saturated chain up to , we can apply to get a chain just as long that goes up to .    "

  "body": "Dimension and Height    I don't like heights. This is why I stopped growing at fifth grade.   Billy Crystal    We will now spend a while discussing the notion of dimension of a ring and dimension of a variety. To motivate the definition, let's first think in terms of varieties.  We take our inspiration from the fundamental setting of dimension theory: vector spaces. The notion of basis doesn't make sense for varieties (What does it mean to span? Where is zero?), but one relevant thing we do have for both vector spaces and for varieties is subobjects.  One way to characterize the dimension of a vector space is the the largest number such that there is a proper chain of subspaces We can try something similar for varieties, but for a reducible variety, this is not a very good notion. For example, for a union of points, we can cook up a chain of proper subvarieties by adding one more point each time, but a point should be zero-dimensional by any reasonable measure. So, if we want this approach to work, we should stick to chains of irreducible subvarieties.   Dimension of Variety   The dimension dimension of a variety of an affine variety is defined as     Krull Dimension of a Ring   The Krull dimension Krull dimension dimension of a ring is We often call it simply the dimension of . Alternatively, is the supremum of the lengths of saturated chains of primes of .    Dimension of a Module   The dimension dimension of a module of an -module is defined as .         The dimension of any field is zero.    A ring is zero-dimensional if and only if every minimal prime of is a maximal ideal.    The ring of integers has dimension , since there is one minimal prime and every other prime is maximal. Likewise, any PID that is not a field has dimension one.       UFD height 1   Let be a ring and be an ideal in . If is a UFD, is a prime of height one if and only if for a prime element .    If with irreducible, and , then contains some nonzero multiple of , say with and coprime. Since , , so we must have , so . Thus, has height one. On the other hand, if is a prime of height one, we claim contains an irreducible element. Indeed, is nonzero, so contains some , and primeness implies one of the prime factors of is contained in . Thus, any nonzero prime contains a prime ideal of the form , so a height one prime must be of this form.    Dim of is Zero  For a field , the ring is not noetherian, as is an infinite ascending chain, so is not noetherian. However, is a maximal ideal, and hence is the unique minimal prime of , which is also maximal. Therefore, .   Nagata  Let be a polynomial ring in infinitely many variables, which we are thinking of as arranged in an infinite triangle. The ring is clearly infinite-dimensional and not noetherian. Let and . Note that is an intersection of multiplicatively closed subsets, so this is a valid localization of .  For any , we have a chain of primes in . As these primes are all contained in , none of these intersects , so the expansion to of the chain above yields a proper chain of primes in . It follows that for all , so is infinite-dimensional.  It turns out that is noetherian, which is not at all obvious and a bit technical, so we will not prove it.   Properties of Dimension and Height   Let be a ring.   A prime has height zero if and only if it is a minimal prime of .    An ideal has height zero if and only if it is contained in a minimal prime of . In particular, in a domain, every nonzero ideal has positive height.     .     .    If is an ideal, then .    If is prime,     If is an ideal,     If is a multiplicative set, then .    If is prime, then .    If are primes, then is the supremum of the lengths of saturated chains of primes in of the form .       We will prove some of these and leave the rest as an exercise.  A prime has height if and only if it contains no other prime, which is equivalent being a minimal prime of .  If is contained in a minimal prime of , then by (1), so by definition. Conversely, if , by definition, there is a minimal prime of of height , so some minimal prime of is a minimal prime of , so is contained in a minimal prime of .  It suffices to show that if and then . By definition, means that there is a chain of primes By (5), means that there is a chain of primes with . We can assume without loss of generality that , since if not, we can add it to the bottom of the chain. Putting these chains together, we get a chain of length in , so .  Let and . The inequality means that for every minimal prime of , . The inequality implies that there exists a minimal prime of of such that . For such a minimal prime as in the latter statement, using (5), we get the desired conclusion.     We know that in noetherian rings, there can be arbitrarily long chains of primes, since the dimension can be infinite as in Nagata's. On the other hand, any ascending proper chain of primes is finite, as a consequence of the definition. Does this imply that every prime has finite height? This does not prevent that possibility that there could be an infinite descending chain of primes, which would then give any of the primes in the chain infinite height. (This seems strange in conjunction with the fact that in any ring, any prime contains a minimal prime, but it does not contradict this.) Another possible problem is there being two primes such that for all there exists a chain of primes of length from to .  However, we will later show that the height of any ideal in a noetherian ring is finite.   Int Extension of Domains Nonzero Multiple  Let be an integral extension of domains. Show that every nonzero has a nonzero multiple in , meaning that there exists such that and .    Let be an infinite field and . We have shown that and that is the coordinate ring of the curve As is a curve (meaning it is parameterized by a single parameter), we should expect the dimension of the variety , and equivalently of the ring , to be . Let's prove this.  On the one hand, is a domain, so is the unique minimal prime. To show that , we need to show that any nonzero prime ideal is maximal.  Set . We note that does not satisfy any algebraic relation over , so is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable, where that one variable corresponds to . Moreover, note that the inclusion is integral, since satisfies the monic polynomial and satisfies the monic polynomial . Polynomial rings in one variable have dimension , so .  Let be nonzero. Note first that , since if , then there is some nonzero multiple of in by . Since , is maximal. The inclusion is integral: a dependence relation for any representative yields a dependence relation. Since is a field, is a domain, and the inclusion is integral, by we can conclude that is a field, so is a maximal ideal. This shows that every nonzero prime in is maximal, and thus .   Catenary Ring   A ring is catenary caternary ring if for every pair of primes , every saturated chain of primes has the same length.    Equidimensional Ring   A ring is equidimensional equidimensional ring if every maximal ideal has the same finite height, and every minimal prime has the same dimension.     Consider the ring We can find the minimal primes of by computing in . The prime ideals and are incomparable, and , so . We claim that the height of is one: it contains the minimal prime , and any saturated chain from to corresponds to a saturated chain from to in , which must have length 1 since this is a PID. The height of is at least 2, as witnessed by the chain . So is not equidimensional.    The ring is a domain that is not equidimensional. On the one hand, the maximal ideal has height at least two, which we see from the chain Thus . On the other hand, we will show later that the prime ideal has height 1, and it is maximal since . Therefore, , and thus whereas . In fact, , but I won't justify this.  The ring in this example is in fact a catenary domain, which we will not justify. Notice that there are maximal ideals of distinct heights in this ring, for example the ideal given above is a prime of height 1 whereas and the maximal ideal has height 2. Thus this ring is not equidimensional.   "

The map sends a monomial term to a polynomial with unique highest degree term .

Suppose that had height or more. By , we would be able to construct a chain up to $Q_1 $ of length or more, but has height . Thus has height . Since is a UFD, for some prime element , by . After a change of variables, as in , we can assume that is monic in with coefficients in . So are module-finite extensions, and the induction hypothesis applies to . Now is a saturated chain in the domain going up to the maximal ideal . The induction hypothesis then says that this chain has length , so , and .    Dimension of Polynomial Ring   The dimension of the polynomial ring is .    The polynomial ring is a Noether normalization of itself, so says that it must have dimension .    Dimension of Algebra   If is a -algebra, the dimension of is less than or equal to the minimal size of an algebra generating set for over . If and , then is isomorphic to a polynomial ring over , and the generators are algebraically independent.    The first statement is trivial unless is finitely generated, in which case we can write for some ideal , so Suppose we chose to be minimal. If , then , since the zero ideal is not contained in .    F.G. Algebra Catenary Domain   Let be a finitely generated algebra or a quotient of a power series ring over a field. (a) is catenary. If additionally is a domain, then (b) is equidimensional, and (c) for all ideals .    Let be primes in . After quotient out by , we can assume that is a domain and . Fix a saturated chain from to a maximal ideal . Given two saturated chains , from to , the concatenations and are saturated chains from to , so by they must have the same length. It follows that and have the same length.  Equidimensionality is immediate from .  We have and Therefore, it suffices to show the equality for prime ideals, since if attains , which is the minimal value of for , then it also attains the maximal value of for . Now, take a saturated chain of primes from to , and a saturated chain from to a maximal ideal . Since is catenary, has length . Moreover, has length by , and has length by .    Transcendence Basis   Let be an extension of fields. A transcendence basis transcendence basis for over is a maximal algebraically independent subset of over .    Transcendence Basis Well-Defined 1   Let and be two transcendence bases for over . Then, there is some such that is a transcendence basis.    Since is algebraic over , for each there is some such that . We can clear denominators to assume without loss of generality that .  We claim that there is some such that . If not, then for all , and thus that each is algebraic over . Thus, is algebraic over , and since is algebraic over , is algebraic over , which contradicts that is a transcendence basis. This shows the claim.  Now, we claim that for such , is a transcendence basis. Thinking of the equation as a polynomial expression in , is algebraic over , hence is algebraic over , and as well.  If were algebraically dependent, then there is some polynomial equation . This equation must involve , since are algebraically independent. We would then have is algebraic over . But since is algebraic over , we would have that is algebraic over , which would contradict that is a transcendence basis.    Transcendence Basis Well-Defined 2   If and are two transcendence bases for over , then .    Say that . If the intersection has elements, then without loss of generality . Then, for some , is a transcendence basis, and has elements. Replacing with and repeating this process, we obtain a transcendence basis with elements such that . But we must then have that these two transcendence bases are equal, so .    EMPTY transcendence degree  Dimension in F.G.

In particular, if is a Noether normalization for ,      Let , where is an algebraically closed field and are indeterminates. Then and these last three are algebraically independent over . Thus, .    Let us use our dimension theorems to give two different proofs that over any field , has dimension 2.  First, we claim that is a Noether normalization of . First, note that and are algebraically independent over . Moreover, and satisfies the monic polynomial , so is integral, and thus module-finite by . Therefore, .  Alternatively, one can show that is irreducible, e.g., by thinking of it as a polynomial in and applying Eisenstein's criterion. Then is a prime of height one, so by the dimension of is     Let us compute the dimension of the ring , where We claim that is a Noether normalization. The inclusion is integral, since so satisfies . Similarly, one can show that satisfies . so satisfies .  We also need to show that are algebraically independent over , or equivalently that the map from the polynomial ring with , is injective.  First assume that is algebraically closed. Observe that the map #empty  is surjective: given , write , and note that is an element of that maps to . Thus, the kernel of the induced map on coordinate rings is ; i.e, the map is injective. By the Nullstellensatz, , and our induced map on coordinate rings is the map #empty Since this map is injective, and this factors as #empty the first map is injective.   "

  "body": "Artinian Rings  An Artin ring is one which satisfies the d.c.c. (or equivalently the minimal condition) on ideals.  The apparent symmetry with Noetherian rings is however misleading. In fact we will show that an Artin ring is necessarily Noetherian and of a very special kind. In a sense an Artin ring is the simplest kind of ring after a field, and we study them not because of their generality but because of their simplicity.    In an artinian ring every prime ideal is maximal.    Let be a prime ideal of . Then is an artinian integral domain. Let . By the d.c.c. we have for some , hence for some . Since is an integral domain and , it follows that we may cancel , hence . Hence has an inverse in , and therefore is a field, so that is a maximal ideal.      In an artinian ring the nilradical is equal to the Jacobson radical.      An artinian ring has only a finite number of maximal ideals.    Consider the set of all finite intersections , where the are maximal ideals. This set has a minimal element, say ; hence for any maximal ideal we have , and therefore . By (1.11) for some , hence since is maximal.      In an artinian ring the nilradical is nilpotent.    By d.c.c. we have say, for some . Suppose , and let denote the set of all ideals such that . Then is not empty, since . Let be a minimal element of ; then there exists such that ; we have , hence by the minimality of . But , and , hence (again by minimality). Hence for some , and therefore . But , hence is nilpotent and therefore . This contradicts the choice of , therefore .    By a chain of prime ideals of a ring we mean a finite strictly increasing sequence ; the length of the chain is . We define the dimension of to be the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals in : it is an integer , or (assuming ). A field has dimension 0 ; the ring has dimension 1 .    A ring is artinian is noetherian and .     : By (8.1) we have . Let be the distinct maximal ideals of . Then . Hence by (6.11) is Noetherian.   : Since the zero ideal has a primary decomposition (7.13), has only a finite number of minimal prime ideals, and these are all maximal since . Hence say; we have by (7.15), hence as in the previous part of the proof. Hence by (6.11) is an Artin ring.    If is an Artin local ring with maximal ideal , then is the only prime ideal of and therefore is the nilradical of . Hence every element of is nilpotent, and itself is nilpotent. Every element of is either a unit or is nilpotent. An example of such a ring is , where is prime and .    Let be a Noetherian local ring, its maximal ideal. Then exactly one of the following two statements is true: i) for all ; ii) for some , in which case is an Artin local ring.    Suppose for some . By Nakayama’s lemma (2.6) we have . Let be any prime ideal of . Then , hence (taking radicals) . Hence is the only prime ideal of and therefore is Artinian.    Structure Theorem for Artinian Rings   An Artin ring is uniquely (up to isomorphism) a finite direct product of Artin local rings.    Let be the distinct maximal ideals of . From the proof of (8.5) we have for some . By (1.16) the ideals are coprime in pairs, hence by (1.10). Consequently by (1.10) again the natural mapping is an isomorphism. Each is an Artin local ring, hence is a direct product of Artin local rings.  Conversely, suppose , where the are Artin local rings. Then for each we have a natural surjective homomorphism (projection on the th factor) . Let . By (1.10) the are pairwise coprime, and . Let be the unique prime ideal of , and let be its contraction . The ideal is prime and therefore maximal by (8.1). Since is nilpotent it follows that is -primary, and hence is a primary decomposition of the zero ideal in . Since the are pairwise coprime, so are the , and they are therefore isolated prime ideals of (0). Hence all the primary components are isolated, and therefore uniquely determined by , by the 2nd uniqueness theorem (4.11). Hence the rings are uniquely determined by .     A ring with only one prime ideal need not be Noetherian (and hence not an Artin ring). Let be the polynomial ring in a countably infinite set of indeterminates over a field , and let a be the ideal , ). The ring has only one prime ideal (namely the image of ), hence is a local ring of dimension 0 . But is not Noetherian, for it is not difficult to see that its prime ideal is not finitely generated.   If is a local ring, its maximal ideal, its residue field, the -module is annihilated by and therefore has the structure of a -vector space. If is finitely generated (e.g., if is Noetherian), the images in of a set of generators of will span as a vector space, and therefore is finite. (See (2.8).)    Let be an Artin local ring. Then the following are equivalent:  Every ideal in is principal;  The maximal ideal is principal;   .        i) ii) iii) is clear.  iii) i): If , then , hence by Nakayama’s lemma (2.6), and therefore is a field and there is nothing to prove.

We have , hence is nilpotent by (8.4) and therefore there exists an integer such that ; hence there exists such that , ; consequently and is a unit in . Hence , therefore and hence . Hence is principal.       The rings ( prime), irreducible) satisfy the conditions of (8.7). On the other hand, the Artin local ring does not: here is generated by and , so that and .   "

  "title": "Discrete Valuation Rings and Dedekind Domains",
  "body": "Discrete Valuation Rings and Dedekind Domains  Discrete Valuation Rings  As we have indicated before, algebraic number theory is one of the historical sources of commutative algebra. In this chapter we specialize down to the case of interest in number theory, namely to Dedekind domains. We deduce the unique factorization of ideals in Dedekind domains from the general primary decomposition theorems. Although a direct approach is of course possible one obtains more insight our way into the precise context of number theory in commutative algebra. Another important class of Dedekind domains occurs in connection with non-singular algebraic curves. In fact the geometrical picture of the Dedekind condition is: non-singular of dimension one.  The last chapter dealt with Noetherian rings of dimension 0 . Here we start by considering the next simplest case, namely Noetherian integral domains of dimension one: i.e., Noetherian domains in which every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. The first result is that in such a ring we have a unique factorization theorem for ideals:    Let be a Noetherian domain of dimension 1. Then every non-zero ideal a in can be uniquely expressed as a product of primary ideals whose radicals are all distinct.    Since is Noetherian, a has a minimal primary decomposition by (7.13), where each is say -primary. Since and is an integral domain, each non-zero prime ideal of is maximal, hence the are distinct maximal ideals (since ), and are therefore pairwise coprime. Hence by (1.16) the are pairwise coprime and therefore by (1.10) we have . Hence .    Conversely, if , the same argument shows that ; this is a minimal primary decomposition of , in which each is an isolated primary component, and is therefore unique by (4.11).  Let be a Noetherian domain of dimension one in which every primary ideal is a prime power. By (9.1), in such a ring we shall have unique factorization of non-zero ideals into products of prime ideals. If we localize with respect to a non-zero prime ideal we get a local ring satisfying the same conditions as , and therefore in every non-zero ideal is a power of the maximal ideal. Such local rings can be characterized in other ways.  Let be a field. A discrete valuation on is a mapping of onto (where is the multiplicative group of ) such that      , i.e., is a homomorphism;     .     The set consisting of 0 and all such that is a ring, called the valuation ring of . It is a valuation ring of the field . It is sometimes convenient to extend to the whole of by putting .  Examples. The two standard examples are:      . Take a fixed prime , then any non zero can be written uniquely in the form , where and both numerator and denominator of are prime to . Define to be . The valuation ring of is the local ring      , where is a field and an indeterminate. Take a fixed irreducible polynomial and define just as in 1 ). The valuation ring of is then the local ring of with respect to the prime ideal .     An integral domain is a discrete valuation ring if there is a discrete valuation of its field of fractions such that is the valuation ring of . By (5.18), is a local ring, anci its maximal ideal is the set of all such that .  If two elements of have the same value, that is if , then and therefore is a unit in . Hence .  If is an ideal in , there is a least integer such that for some . It follows that contains every with , and therefore the only ideals in are the ideals . These form a single chain , and therefore is Noetherian.  Moreover, since is surjective, there exists such that , and then , and . Hence is the only non-zero prime ideal of , and is thus a Noetherian local domain of dimension one in which every non-zero ideal is a power of the maximal ideal. In fact many of these properties are characteristic of discrete valuation rings.    Let be a Noetherian local domain of dimension one, its maximal ideal, its residue field. Then the following are equivalent: i) is a discrete valuation ring; ii) is integrally closed; iii) is a principal ideal; iv) ; v) Every non-zero ideal is a power of ; vi) There exists such that every non-zero ideal is of the form , .    Before we start going the rounds, we make two remarks: (A) If is an ideal , (1), then is -primary and for some . For , since is the only non-zero prime ideal; now use (7.16). (B) for all . This follows from (8.6). i) ii) by (5.18). ii) iii). Let and . By remark (A) there exists an integer such that . Choose and , and let  , the field of fractions of . We have (since ), hence is not integral over , and therefore by (5.1) we have (for if , m would be a faithful -module, finitely generated as an -module). But by construction of , hence and therefore . iii) iv). By (2.8) we have , and by remark (B) . iv) ). Let be an ideal , (1). By remark (A) we have for some ; from (8.8) (applied to ) it follows that is a power of . v) vi). By remark (B), , hence there exists . But by hypothesis, hence . vi) i). Clearly , hence by remark (B). Hence if is any non-zero element of , we have for exactly one value of . Define and extend to by defining . Check that is well-defined and is a discrete valuation, and that is the valuation ring of .     Dedekind Domains    Let be a Noetherian domain of dimension one. Then the following are equivalent: i) is integrally closed; ii) Every primary ideal in is a prime power; iii) Every local ring is a discrete valuation ring.    i) iii) by (9.2) and (5.13). ii) iii). Use (9.2) and the fact that primary ideals and powers of ideals behave well under localization: (4.8), (3.11).    A ring satisfying the conditions of (9.3) is called a Dedekind domain.    In a Dedekind domain every non-zero ideal has a unique factorization as a product of prime ideals.    (9.1) and (9.3).    Examples.     1) Any principal ideal domain A. For is Noetherian (since every ideal is finitely generated) and of dimension one (Example 3 after (1.6)). Also every local ring is a principal ideal domain, hence by a discrete valuation ring; hence is a Dedekind domain by (9.3).    Let be an algebraic number field (a finite algebraic extension of ). Its ring of integers is the integral closure of in . (For example, if , then , the ring of Gaussian integers.) Then is a Dedekind domain:       The ring of integers in an algebraic number field is a Dedekind domain.     is a separable extension of (because the characteristic is zero), hence by (5.17) there is a basis of over such that , Hence is finitely generated as a -module and therefore Noetherian. Also is integrally closed by (5.5). To complete the proof we must show that every nonzero prime ideal of is maximal, and this follows from (5.8) and (5.9): (5.9) shows that , hence is a maximal ideal of and therefore is maximal in by (5.8).    Remark. The unique factorization theorem (9.4) was originally proved for rings of integers in algebraic number fields. The uniqueness theorems of Chapter 4 may be regarded as generalizations of this result: prime powers have to be replaced by primary ideals, and products by intersections.   Fractional Ideals  Let be an integral domain, its field of fractions. An -submodule of is a fractional ideal of if for some in . In particular, the \"ordinary\" ideals (now called integral ideals) are fractional ideals (take ). Any element generates a fractional ideal, denoted by or , and called principal. If is a fractional ideal, the set of all such that is denoted by .  Every finitely generated -submodule of is a fractional ideal. For if is generated by , we can write where and are in , and then . Conversely, if is Noetherian, every fractional ideal is finitely generated, for it is of the form for some integral ideal .  An -submodule of is an invertible ideal if there exists a submodule of such that . The module is then unique and equal to , for we have . It follows that is finitely generated, and therefore a fractional ideal: for since there exist and such that , and hence for any we have : each , so that is generated by .  Clearly every non-zero principal fractional ideal is invertible, its inverse being . The invertible ideals form a group with respect to multiplication, whose identity element is (1).  Invertibility is a local property:    For a fractional ideal , the following are equivalent: i) is invertible; ii) is finitely generated and, for each prime ideal is invertible: iii) is finitely generated and, for each maximal ideal is invertible.    i) ii): by (3.11) and (3.15) (for is finitely generated, because invertible). ii) iii) as usual. iii : Let , which is an integral ideal. For each maximal ideal we have (by (3.11) and (3.15)) because is invertible. Hence . Consequently and therefore is invertible.      Let be a local domain. Then is a discrete valuation ring every non-zero fractional ideal of is invertible.     . Let be a generator of the maximal ideal of , and let be a fractional ideal. Then there exists such that : thus is an integral ideal, say , and therefore where .   : Every non-zero integral ideal is invertible and therefore finitely generated; so that is Noetherian. It is therefore enough to prove that every nonzero integral ideal is a power of . Suppose this is false; let be the set of nonzero ideals which are not powers of , and let be a maximal element of . Then , hence ; hence is a proper (integral) ideal, and . If , then and therefore by Nakayama’s lemma (2.6); hence and hence is a power of (by the maximality of ). Hence is a power of : contradiction.    The \"global\" counterpart of (9.7) is    Let be an integral domain. Then is a Dedekind domain every non-zero fractional ideal of is invertible.     : Let be a fractional ideal. Since is Noetherian, is finitely generated. For each prime ideal is a fractional ideal of the discrete valuation ring , hence is invertible by (9.7). Hence is invertible, by (9.6).   : Every non-zero integral ideal is invertible, hence finitely generated, hence is Noetherian. We shall show that each is a discrete valuation ring. For this it is enough to show that each integral ideal in is invertible, and then use (9.7). Let be an (integral) ideal in , and let . Then is invertible, hence is invertible by (9.7).      If is a Dedekind domain, the non-zero fractional ideals of form a group with respect to multiplication.        This group is called the group of ideals of ; we denote it by . In this terminology (9.4) says that is a free (abelian) group, generated by the non-zero prime ideals of .  Let denote the multiplicative group of the field of fractions of . Each defines a fractional ideal , and the mapping is a homomorphism . The image of is the group of principal fractional ideals: the quotient group is called the ideal class group of . The kernel of is the set of all such that , so that it is the group of units of . We have an exact sequence     Remark. For the Dedekind domains that arise in number theory, there are classical theorems relating to the groups and . Let be an algebraic number field and let be its ring of integers, which is a Dedekind domain by (9.5). In this case:      is a finite group. Its order is the class number of the field . The following are equivalent: (i) ; (ii) ; (iii) is a principal ideal domain; (iv) is a unique factorization domain.     is a finitely-generated abelian group. More precisely, we can specify the number of generators of . First, the elements of finite order in are just the roots of unity which lie in , and they form a finite cyclic group is torsion-free. The number of generators of is given as follows: if there are distinct embeddings (the field of complex numbers). Of these, say map into , and the rest pair off (if is one, then is a nother, where is the automorphism of defined by into say pairs: thus . The number of generators of is then .     The proofs of these results belong to algebraic number theory and not to commutative algebra: they require techniques of a different nature from those used in this book.  Examples. 1) ; . The only units in are the four roots of unity . 2) , and is infinite cyclic. In fact the units in are , where is any rational integer.   "

  "title": "Injective Modules in Noetherian Rings",
  "body": "Injective Modules in Noetherian Rings  So far, our observations on injectives are very general. For noetherian rings, there is a beautiful structure theory of injective modules due to Bass. To prepare for the first step, we note:    If is a finitely generated -module, and is an arbitrary family of modules, then   If , then         If is noetherian, then every direct sum of injective -modules is injective.    Let be a family of injective modules. For an ideal and any  is surjective. Applying the previous lemma and the hypothesis that is finitely generated, the composition is surjective. By Baer’s criterion, is injective.    Associated Primes  Evidently, the injective hulls of prime cyclic modules, , are injective modules. They will be the building blocks in the structure theory. Both to that end and for our purposes later, we will want to understand their structure. We collect some of their key properties here.  Before we do this, we recall some facts about modules that are not necessarily finitely generated.  Recall that is an associated prime of a module if there is an embedding ; we write for the set of associated primes of . For a general module,    need not be finite, and     does not necessarily agree with .     However, implies , and if is noetherian,     if , then , and     for some .     Proof. For the first, take some nonzero . For the second, we note that if , which yields \" ,\" and if in , then must contain an associated prime of , which is an associated prime of .   -torsion  A module is -torsion if for every such that . This does not necessarily imply that there is some such that . If is noetherian and then the following are equivalent:      is -torsion;     , there is an such that for all ;     .     Proof. For the equivalence of the first two, we note that , so a large power of kills an element iff large powers of each do. This uses finite generation in a crucial way. The first implies the third since contains a nonzerodivisor on the domain , and any power of this element does not kill the generator of . The third implies the first, since, for each , the associated primes of the cyclic module all are contained in , so  .     If is an essential extension, then .    We only need to see that an associated prime of is also associated to . If generates a cyclic submodule of isomorphic to , then any nonzero multiple of does as well; since has a nonzero multiple in , we are done.      Let be a prime in a noetherian ring . Let be the fraction field of (equivalently, the residue field of .) Let be an injective hull for .     If , then is an isomorphism, hence .     .     is an essential extension of -modules and is an injective hull of as an -module.     is -torsion, and .     and for another prime .        Proof. 4. This is immediate from the previous lemma and the discussion above it.     By Example ??, is an essential extension, so must contain a copy of ; we identify with its isomorphic copy in are all essential. Since multiplication by is one-to-one on , it must be one-to-one on its essential extension . Then, the submodule is injective, so a direct summand of . But, since is essential, cannot decompose as a nontrivial direct sum, so .    By part (1), is a -vector space, and contains the copy of we found earlier, so splits. Since the extensions are essential, cannot decompose as a nontrivial direct sum of -vector spaces.    Since is essential as -modules, it is clearly essential as -modules. (Any nonzero element has a nonzero -multiple, hence a nonzero -multiple in the submodule.) To see that is a maximal essential extension of as an -module, let be an essential extension of -modules. For any nonzero , there is some nonzero multiple in , with . Then is a nonzero multiple of in , so is an essential extension as -modules, so .    We recall that can be identified with the submodule of consisting of elements killed by .     Then, the first isomorphism follows from part (2) applied in .  Set . By (4), only if . By , which by (4) has as its only associated prime; in particular, no element is killed by , so the hom is zero.   We can now prove the structure theorem for injective modules.    Let be a noetherian ring and an injective -module. There is a direct sum decomposition and the multiplicities are uniquely determined by the formula , where .    By Zorn’s lemma, there is a submodule (not a priori nonzero) of that is   isomorphic to a direct sum of injective hulls of prime cyclic modules: ,    and no other submodule of contains and admits a decomposition of this form.     By Proposition ??, is injective, so we can write for some . If , take . The inclusion map extends along the inclusion to a map since is injective; since the inclusion is essential, embeds into . Since is injective, it splits from , and we contradict the maximality of . Thus, a decomposition as promised exists. Given such a decomposition, the formulas for follow from part (5) of the previous theorem.    Thus, injective modules are uniquely determined by a multiplicity for each prime. This structural data, for the modules appearing in a minimal injective resolution of a module, are called Bass numbers.    (Bass numbers). Let be a noetherian ring, and an -module. Given a minimal injective resolution and decompositions we call the -th Bass number of with respect to .      Let be a noetherian ring, and an -module. The Bass numbers of can be computed as     Given a minimal injective resolution we leave it as an exercise to check that is a minimal injective resolution of as an -module, and that the number of copies of in is the same as the number of copies of in . We compute the Ext modules in the statement from the latter injective resolution:   Claim. The differentials in the complex above are zero.  We need to show that for any -linear , the composition is the zero map. Let , and suppose that in . The minimality of the injective resolution implies that has a nonzero multiple in the image of . Since is a field, this implies that is in the image of , and hence in the kernel of , establishing the claim.  The proof of the theorem is now immediate, since the homology of the complex in the i-th spot is , which, by the previous theorem, is a -vector space of rank .      If is noetherian, and is a finitely generated -module, all of the Bass numbers of are finite.    We can compute by taking a minimal free resolution of , applying , and computing homology. The complex we obtain consists of finitely generated modules, so its homology modules are finitely generated modules.     Example 2.30. Let’s compute the Bass numbers of as a -module. We claim that   To see the first isomorphism, consider an element with in lowest terms. We want to see that has a unique expression as a sum of elements of . We can discard any terms with denominators not dividing , since . Write . Then, by the Chinese remainder theorem   In each of these congruence equations, the product of prime powers on the RHS is a unit, so we can solve uniquely for each ; that is, each is uniquely determined. This establishes the first isomorphism.  For the second, it suffices to note that is divisible (check it!), that it is -torsion (clear), and that the annihilator of in this module is isomorphic to . From these observations, we see that the module is injective by Proposition ??, and that it is an essential extension of by Example ??.  We conclude that the Bass numbers of are   Each Bass number here is either 0 or 1 . We caution that the \"total first Bass number,\" the sum of the first Bass numbers, is infinite.   We note also that this 116 esque game of writing a fraction as a sum of fractions with pure-power denominators is very closely related to the calculation of local cohomology.  We now know that the indecomposable injectives of a noetherian ring are all of the form , that every injective is (in a unique way) a direct sum of these, and finitely generated modules all have injective resolutions in which each injective has a finite number of copies of in its direct sum decomposition. We also know many of the key structural properties of , as collected in Theorem ??.  We will want to have a better understanding of for the residue field of a local ring in order to the develop the duality theory hinted at on the first day of class. We note that this encompasses any indecomposable injective : by part (3) of Theorem ??, for and the residue field of . We will pursue this with a little bit of redundancy. First, we will discuss a model for when has a coefficient field (e.g., when is complete) and the Matlis duality functor in that setting. Then, we will develop the duality theory in full generality.

  "body": "Definitions of Local Cohomology  Recall that we defined . Now, with the theory of injectives we have so far, we can prove some properties about these functors. But first we want to collect some other definitions of local cohomology. Some of our descriptions involve direct limits. We recall a couple of facts about direct limits.    Given a directed system of modules its direct limit is the module , equipped with maps for all , satisfying the property that, if there are maps that commute with the maps in the system, then there is a unique map such that for all .  This notion is functorial: given two directed systems of complexes, and maps of complexes for each that commute with the maps in the systems, there is an induced map on the direct limits.  Direct limits can be realized explicitly as follows: every element is represented by a class with . Two classes are the same if and only if for some , the images of and under the composed transition maps agree in . In particular, an element represents the zero class if and only if it is in the kernel of a large composition of the transition map.  Similar considerations hold for systems indexed by an arbitrary poset ; this consists of a collection of modules for , and commuting maps for all .     Remark 3.2. We defined the tensor product of complexes in terms of homological notation before. The same definition works with cohomological indexing.

It is enough to show the later statement. Note that     Then, if is an injective resolution, then     It is easy to see that these isomorphisms are functorial.     image     Remark 3.5. Earlier, we saw that Koszul cohomology and measure similar things, and are equal when , is generated by a regular sequence. Since form an -sequence as well in this case, we obtain isomorphisms though we should take care that we have the right maps in the directed system.  In general, Koszul cohomology and are not the same; we have seen examples in the homework. However, we will soon see that they agree in the direct limit; the isomorphism above holds for all ideals in a noetherian ring!   Let be an -module and . To compute the limit of the system we can replace by , where are the elements killed by some composition of the maps .   so the direct limit is . Note that we have a commutative square    image    so we can identify with .  Now consider a directed system of (cohomological) Koszul complexes. that is,   The limit of this system of Koszul complexes is the Čech complex of on :   Given a sequence of elements , the maps given by 1 on on , induce maps   Note that     Definition 3.6 (Čech complex). We define the Čech complex of on as This is also sometimes denoted as .     Example 3.7.    image    As with the Koszul complex, easy inductions show that        The maps between components corresponding to subsets are zero if , and if .     Note that    We will now study these cohomology modules.    Proposition 3.8. Let and .   (1) Given a short exact sequence of R-modules     there is a long exact sequence       (2) For an arbitrary direct limit system, .    (3) For any family of modules .    (4) (invariance of base) If is a ring map, an -module, then          Proof.  (1) Since consists of flat modules,    image    is a short exact sequence of complexes, so this induces a long exact sequence in cohomology.     (3) This is easy to see, since the Cech complex is compatible with the direct sum decomposition.  (4) Follows from the same property noted for Koszul complexes.      Theorem 3.9 (Fundamental Theorem of Local Cohomology). Let be a noetherian ring and an ideal. Then, for all -modules ,   These isomorphisms are functorial in and extend to isomorphisms of long exact sequences given a short exact sequence     We have seen that and . To show that , we proceed in the following steps:  Step 1: Show and are canonically isomorphic.  Step 2: Show that for any injective module .  Step 3: Use the previous steps to conclude the proof.  Proof of Step 1:     We note that the last equality uses finite generation of in a crucial way; only the containment \" \" holds in general without this.  Proof of Step 2: By the structure theorem for injectives over noetherian rings, , where   By the direct sum property, we may replace by . By the invariance of base property, we may replace by . Now, is an injective hull of the residue field, so it is artinian, and we write where the are modules of finite length. It suffices to show that the vanishing holds for modules of finite length.  We claim that if the desired vanishing holds for , then it holds for all modules of finite length (which would complete Step 2). We induce on the length of . If , then write , with . The long exact sequence gives and by the induction hypothesis, for , establishing the claim.  Applying the invariance of base property again, we may assume without loss of generality that .  There are multiple ways to deal with this case. We note that if , then , and if , then . It is then an easy exercise, which we leave to you, to show that for and 0 for if all ’s are zero, and that for all otherwise.  Of course, this step relied crucially on the structure theorem for injectives over noetherian rings.  Proof of Step 3: This follows in complete generality from the previous steps.  We proceed by induction on , with the base case being Step 1 . Now, let .  We assume that we have a canonical isomorphism between and for all and all . Embed into an injective to get a short exact sequence   Then, there is a commutative diagram    image    where bottom zero on the right comes from Step 2. This induces an isomorphism . We omit the verification that this isomorphism does not depend on the choice of embedding into an injective, and that these isomorphisms are compatible with the connecting maps of long exact sequences.    These four different descriptions of local cohomology all have different advantages for attacking problems.  The descriptions (1) and (1’) are computed from injective resolutions, as opposed to (2) and ’), which are computed from generators. We might think of the former as being more natural, and the latter as being more flexible.  We note that the descriptions (1) and (2) are made entirely from \"big\" modules that are somehow nice, whereas the descriptions (1’) and (2’) realize local cohomology as limits of finitely generated modules (if is). Some natural questions to ask already are whether we can realize the limits in (1’) and (2’) as filtered limits \/ unions, and whether the resulting limits are determined in some sense by finite stages in the limit system. We will see a few results of this form, but it’s worth noting that questions of this form are an active topic of research.  "

We note that many (but not all) of the following facts can be proven quickly from more than one characterization of local cohomology.  Let be a noetherian ring, an ideal, and an -module. Let be a ring homomorphism, and an -module.      is -torsion for every .    If , then for every .    (Invariance of base) has a natural -module structure, and as -modules. We often write to abbreviate this when the map is implicit.    For any arbitrary direct limit system, .    (Flat base change) If is flat, then .    If , then .     Proof. 1. Any submodule or quotient module of an -torsion module is -torsion. Thus, the cohomology of a complex of -torsion modules, e.g., for some injective resolution , is also -torsion.     The functors and are the same, so they yield the same thing when applied to an injective resolution.    For any , the -linear map is the same as the -linear map ; this gives a by functoriality; it follows from functoriality that the map agrees with the composition of maps and , so this is an -module action.     The noted isomorphism follows from the Čech cohomology isomorphism .     This again follows from the Čech cohomology statement.     . By flatness of , cohomology commutes with taking the tensor product.    Special case of flat base change.     We will find that we have the best understanding of local cohomology modules in two situations: when is a maximal ideal, or when is a regular ring. Apropos the first of these settings:  Proposition 3.11. Let be a noetherian ring, an ideal, and an -module. Let be a maximal ideal of .    If is finitely generated, then is artinian for all .     .    If is local, then . In particular, if is finitely generated, then .    If is a local homomorphism, and is module-finite over the image of , then .    Proof. 1. By Problem #6 of HW #1, if is an injective resolution,     The Bass number is finite, so the complex above is a complex of artinian modules. Thus, is a quotient of a submodule of a finite direct sum of copies of , hence, artinian.    If is -torsion, then any element outside of acts on invertibly (check!). Then the second is a special case of 6 above.    By flat base change, . Since is -torsion, it is already the same as .     , since .    Remark 3.12. Both and of the previous proposition fail for the module from worksheet , with replaced by .  We want to note now that if is a graded ring, a graded module, and a homogeneous ideal (i.e., an ideal generated by homogeneous elements ) then the local cohomology modules are graded as well. This can be seen from the Čech complex:     which is evidently a complex of graded modules in this case.  We could also see the grading from the other descriptions of local cohomology. This clear for the Koszul description, and is easily seen to give the same grading. There is also a classification of which graded modules are injective as objects in the category of graded modules. This endows the other two descriptions of local cohomology with a grading, and the Fundamental Theorem is compatible with this extra structure. We won’t develop this approach (unless I change my mind!), but note that it is carried out throughly in Bruns & Herzog as well as Brodmann & Sharp.  Our goal now is to understand, for an ideal in a noetherian , and an -module , what are the least and greatest , respectively, for which .  There is an obvious guess (and obvious lower bound) for the least nonvanishing index: the depth of on . This guess turns out to be correct.  Theorem 3.13. Let be a noetherian ring, an ideal, and a finitely generated -module. Then,     Our convention is that if . In particular, if is prime and is Cohen-Macaulay, then     Proof. If , then there is some that acts as the identity on , so  for all . On the other hand, is -torsion, so it must be the zero module.  We now assume that and argue by induction on the depth.  If , then every element of is a zerodivisor on , so is contained in the union of the associated primes of , and hence in some associated prime of by prime avoidance. Then, the copy of in is killed by , hence nonzero in .  Now, if the depth is , take a regular element on . The SES     yields the LES     For , we obtain that is a nzd on , but this module is -torsion (hence -torsion), so it must be zero. Then, the LES shows that injects into , so the latter is nonzero.  We turn our attention to the top nonvanishing local cohomology module. This will be of recurring interest, so we give it some nomenclature.  Definition 3.14. Let be a ring, an ideal, and an -module. The cohomological dimension of on is     This is closely related to another invariant of independent interest.  Definition 3.15. Let be a ring, an ideal. The arithmetic rank of is     The following fact, now easy to prove, is one of the key points to many applications of local cohomology.  Theorem 3.16. Let be a noetherian ring, an ideal. Then for all modules .  Proof. Let . Then , and the latter vanishes for , since the Čech complex on elements lives only in cohomological degrees less than or equal to .  This Theorem is useful both for understanding rank and for understanding cohomological dimension. We will employ it for the latter purpose first.  Example 3.17. Let be a field, and . Let . We saw in worksheet #3 that . We claim that the support of is , so . If is a prime that does not contain or , then is the unit ideal, so . If does not contain , then in , so . Thus, . Similarly, if does not contain , the same vanishing occurs.  Proposition 3.18. Let be a noetherian ring, an ideal. For any -module, .  Proof. Let . Since local cohomology commutes with direct sums, we have that for any free module and any . Now, given an arbitrary module , take a short exact sequence     with free. The LES of local cohomology gives isomorphisms for all . Repeating this, we find for all , that there is some module such that . But, since is finitely generated, is finite, and is less than this number for all modules. Hence, we must have that .  Following the last proposition, we write for . When is a maximal ideal, we can say a bit more about cohomological dimension. Recall that, by the dimension of a module, we mean simply the dimension of . We note that, if is finitely generated, this agrees with the dimension of the support of as a subset of , but this is not true if is arbitrary (e.g. take for of positive dimension).  Proposition 3.19. Let be local, and an -module. Then .  Proof. By the invariance of base property, we may replace by , and by its image there, thus we can assume that . The maximal ideal of is generated by elements up to radical, so , as required.  Corollary 3.20. Let be local. The ring is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if for all .  We want to now extend our cohomological dimension bounds to all ideals.  Theorem 3.21. If is a proper ideal in a local ring of dimension , then .  Proof. If , this is standard, so we assume that the height of is less than .  Let and . We will inductively find     Once we have done this for , we have elements such that , and we are done.  To choose , we only need to avoid a subset of the minimal primes of , which is finite, so we can do this by prime avoidance.  Suppose that we have elements satisfying the specified condition for all . The set of minimal primes of of height not containing , is finite (and is clearly not any such ), so we can choose an element in not in any of these.  Now, suppose that is contained in some in . Then, as well. If is not minimal over , then take some in between. The height of is less than , so contradicts the induction hypothesis. If is minimal over , then , and contradicts the choice of .  Corollary 3.22. If is an ideal in a noetherian ring, and an -module, then  .  Proof. Given a counterexample, we can localize at an associated prime of , and since for all , and , it suffices to assume that is local. Moreover, by invariance of base, we can replace by , and assume that . Then, applying the previous theorem, .  "

The Matlis duals of are evidently finitely generated modules (if is complete), and we might hope that they can be realized by formulas in terms of finitely generated elements.  We will see that this turns out to be true. We will establish formulas of this form for an increasingly general class of rings. Along the way, to understand the new class of rings we will meet, we will pursue a more refined study of injective resolutions.  We will give two proofs of this fact.

Taking homology gives the isomorphism.    To help remember which hypothesis goes with which situation in the following, one might keep in mind that Matlis duals of artinian modules are complete.    Theorem 4.5 (Local Duality). Let be a regular local ring of dimension . Then     If is a finitely generated -module, then .    If is complete and is arbitrary, then .     These isomorphisms are functorial in .    Proof. 1.        Since is complete, . Then,          One often finds the just the first statement as local duality, but the second \"opposite of local duality\" is quite useful as well.  Remark 4.6. By the exact same proof, if is Cohen-Macaulay and is some finitely generated module such that , then    If is a finitely generated -module, then .    If is complete, then by the same proof.    We will return to this later.  Local duality is a powerful tool to study local cohomology modules. Part of its power comes from its flexibility: there are many different rings, modules, and indices to plug in. Here are some special cases:  Example 4.7. Let be a local ring, and another local ring such that is regular, and is a quotient of . (Such an exists whenever is complete, or essentially of finite type over a field or .) Then, since is a finitely generated -module, for all .  Example 4.8. Let be a map of complete local rings, and suppose that is regular, e.g., a power series ring over a field . Then, .  Here is an important application of Local Duality. Note that we are not assuming that is regular in the statement.    Theorem 4.9 (Grothendieck nonvanishing). Let be a local ring and a finitely generated -module. Then .    We already know . Without loss of generality, we can assume that is a faithful module, by invariance of base. Complete; is -faithful, , and . Therefore, we may assume without loss of generality that and are complete.  Now is a quotient of a power series ring, so by invariance of base we may assume without loss of generality that is a regular ring. Note, however, that is not necessarily faithful anymore.  We claim that if the depth of on an -module is , then . This is essentially the same as Rees’s Theorem, but we include the argument anyway. Indeed, by induction on the depth (if positive), we can assume that for an -regular element in . From the usual LES, we see that, for acts injectively on , but annihilates this module as well, so it must be the zero module. This establishes the claim.  Now, by Local Duality, . Since Matlis Duality is faithful, the indicated Ext is nonzero if and only if its dual is. Thus,     Since , equality holds throughout.    Remark 4.10. A consequence of this argument, by taking , is that if is a regular local ring (or any ring for which Local Duality holds!) there are equalities for any ideal :     Of course, these can be obtained more directly (for Cohen-Macaulay rings).  Following Remark ??, we should be able to generalize local duality, so that we can compute local cohomology as duals of Ext modules over rings that are more relevant. The best generalization would be in the case of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring such that . Failing that, we would like to understand when a f.g. module such that exists over a CM local ring, and how else we might recognize such a .  "

  "body": "Ring Theory  In this class, all rings have a multiplicative identity, written as 1 or is we want to emphasize that we are referring to the ring . This is what some authors call unital rings; since for us all rings are unital, we will omit the adjective. Moreover, we will think of 1 as part of the structure of the ring, and thus require it be preserved by all natural constructions. As such, a subring of must share the same multiplicative identity with , meaning . Moreover, any ring homomorphism must preserve the multiplicative identity. To clear any possible confusion, we include below the relevant definitions.  Ring   A ring is a set equipped with two binary operations, + and , satisfying:    is an abelian group with identity element denoted or .    The operation is associative, so that is a semigroup.    For all , we have     there is a multiplicative identity, written as 1 or , such that and for all .       To simplify notation, we will often drop the when writing the multiplication of two elements, so that will mean .  Note that the requirement that makes it so that the zero ring is not a ring.  Commutative Ring   A ring is a commutative ring if for all we have .    Division Ring   A ring is a division ring if and is a group under , so every nonzero has a multiplicative inverse. A field is a commutative division ring.    Integral Domain   A commutative ring is a domain , sometimes called an integral domain , if it has no zerodivisors: or . Note that in particular we reserve the word domain for commutative rings.    For some familiar examples, (the set of matrices) is a ring with the usual addition and multiplication of matrices, and are commutative rings, and are fields, and the real Hamiltonian quaternion ring is a division ring.  Ring Homomorphism   A ring homomorphism is a function satisfying the following:     for all .     for all .     .      Under this definition, the map sending preserves addition and multiplication but not the multiplicative identities, and thus it is not a ring homomorphism.   For any ring , there exists a unique homomorphism .   Subring   A subset of a ring is a subring of if it is a ring under the same addition and multiplication operations and .    So under this definition, , the set of even integers, is not a subring of ; in fact, it is not even a ring, since it does not have a multiplicative identity!  Ideal   Let be a ring. A subset of is an ideal if:      is nonempty.     is a subgroup of .    For every and every , we have and .       The final property is often called absorption. A left ideal satisfies only absorption on the left, meaning that we require only that for all and . Similarly, a right ideal satisfies only absorption on the right, meaning that for all and .  When is a commutative ring, the left ideals, right ideals, and ideals over are all the same. However, if is not commutative, then these can be very different classes.  One key distinction between unital rings and nonunital rings is that if one requires every ring to have a 1 , as we do, then the ideals and subrings of a ring are very different creatures. In fact, the only subring of that is also an ideal is itself. The change lies in what constitutes a subring; notice that nothing has changed in the definition of ideal.   Every ring has two trivial ideals: itself and the zero ideal .   A nontrivial ideal of is an ideal that and . An ideal of is a proper ideal if .  "

Let be a ring with . A left -module is an abelian group together with an action of on , written as , such that for all and we have the following:     ,     ,     , and     .    A right -module is an abelian group together with an action of on , written as , such that for all and we have     ,     ,     , and     .      By default, we will be studying left -modules. To make the writing less heavy, we will sometimes say -module rather than left -module whenever there is no ambiguity.   Remark A.10. If is a commutative ring, then any left -module may be regarded as a right -module by setting . Likewise, any right -module may be regarded as a left -module. Thus for commutative rings, we just refer to modules, and not left or right modules.   The definitions of submodule, quotient of modules, and homomorphism of modules are very natural and easy to guess, but here they are.  Submodule   If are -modules with compatible structures, we say that is a submodule of .  A map between -modules is a homomorphism of -modules if it is a homomorphism of abelian groups that preserves the -action, meaning for all and all . We sometimes refer to -module homomorphisms as -module maps, or maps of -modules. An isomorphism of -modules is a bijective homomorphism, which we really should think about as a relabeling of the elements in our module. If two modules and are isomorphic, we write .  Given an -module and a submodule , the quotient is an -module whose elements are the equivalence classes determined by the relation on given by  . One can check that this set naturally inherits an -module structure from the -module structure on , and it comes equipped with a natural canonical map induced by sending to its equivalence class.     Example A.12. The modules over a field are precisely all the -vector spaces. Linear transformations are precisely all the -module maps.   While vector spaces make for a great first example, be warned that many of the basic facts we are used to from linear algebra are often a little more subtle in commutative algebra. These differences are features, not bugs.   Example A.13. The -modules are precisely all the abelian groups.    Example A.14. When we think of the ring as a module over itself, the submodules of are precisely the ideals of .   First Isomorphism Theorem   Any -module homomorphism satisfies .    The first big noticeable difference between vector spaces and more general -modules is that while every vector space has a basis, most -modules do not.  Generated Modules   A subset of an -module is a generating set, or a set of generators, if every element in can be written as a finite linear combination of elements in with coefficients in . A basis for an -module is a generating set for such that implies for all . An -module is free if it has a basis.     Remark A.17. Every vector space is a free module.    Remark A.18. Every free -module is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of . Indeed, let's construct such an isomorphism for a given free -module . Given a basis for , let   The condition that is a basis for can be restated into the statement that is an isomorphism of -modules.   One of the key things that makes commutative algebra so rich and beautiful is that most modules are in fact not free. In general, every -module has a generating set - for example, itself. Given some generating set for , we can always repeat the idea above and write a presentation for , but in general the resulting map will have a nontrivial kernel. A nonzero kernel element corresponds to a relation between the generators of .   Remark A.19. Given a set of generators for an -module , any homomorphism of modules is determined by the images of the generators.   We say that a module is finitely generated if we can find a finite generating set for . The simplest finitely generated modules are the cyclic modules.   Example A.20. An -module is cyclic if it can be generated by one element. Equivalently, we can write as a quotient of by some ideal . Indeed, given a generator for , the kernel of the map induced by is some ideal . Since we assumed that generates is automatically surjective, and thus induces an isomorphism .   Similarly, if an -module has generators, we can naturally think about it as a quotient of by the submodule of relations among those generators.  "

  "body": "Getting Started  A Macaulay2 session often starts with defining some ambient ring we will be doing computations over. Common rings such as the rationals and the integers can be defined using the commands QQ and ZZ ; one can easily take quotients or build polynomial rings (in finitely many variables) over these. For example,  i1 : R = ZZ\/101[x,y] o1 = R o1 : PolynomialRing and i1 : k = ZZ\/101; i2 : R = k[x,y];  both store the ring as , with the small difference that in the second example Macaulay2 has named the coefficient field . One quirk that might make a difference later is that if we use the first option and later set to be the field , our ring is not a polynomial ring over . Also, in the second example we ended each line with a ; , which tells Macaulay2 to run the command but not display the result of the computation — which is in this case was simply an assignment, so the result is not relevant.  We can now do all sorts of computations over our ring . For example, we can define an ideal in as follows:  i3 : I = ideal(x^2,y^2,x*y) 2 2 o3 = ideal (x , y , x*y) o3 : Ideal of R  Above we have set to be the ideal in that is generated by . The notation ideal( ) requires the usage of ^ for powers and * for products; alternatively, we can define the exact same ideal with the notation ideal\" \" , as follows:  i3 : I = ideal\"x2,y2,xy\" 2 2 o3 = ideal (x , y , x*y) o3 : Ideal of R  Now we can use this ideal to either define a quotient ring or the -module , as follows:  i4 : M = R^1\/I o4 = cokernel | x2 y2 xy | 1 o4 : R-module, quotient of R i5 : S = R\/I o5 = S o5 : QuotientRing  It's important to note that while is a ring, is the -module — this is a very important difference for Macaulay2, since these two objects have different types. So defined above is a ring, while is a module. Notice that Macaulay2 stored the module as the cokernel of the map   When you make a new definition in Macaulay2, you might want to pay attention to what ring your new object is defined over. For example, now that we defined this ring , Macaulay2 has automatically taken to be our current ambient ring, and any calculation or definition we run next will be considered over and not . If you want to return to the original ring , you must first run the command use R   If you want to work over a finitely generated algebra over one of the basic rings you can define in Macaulay2, and your ring is not a quotient of a polynomial ring, you want to rewrite this algebra as a quotient of a polynomial ring. For example, suppose you want to work over the second Veronese in variables over our field from before, meaning the algebra . We need algebra generators, which we will call corresponding to and :  o6 = U o6 : PolynomialRing i7 : f = map(R,U,{x^2,x*y,y^2}) 2 2 o7 = map(R,U,{x , x*y, y }) o7 : RingMap R <--- U i8 : J = ker f 2 o8 = ideal(b - a*c) o8 : Ideal of U i9 : T = U\/J o9 = T o9 : QuotientRing  Our ring at the end is isomorphic to the 2nd Veronese of , which is the ring we wanted. Note the syntax order in map : first target, then source, then a list with the images of each algebra generator.  "

  "body": "Basic Commands  Many Macaulay2 commands are easy to guess, and named exactly what you would expect them to be named. Often, googling “Macaulay2” followed by a few descriptive words will easily land you on the documentation for whatever you are trying to do.  Here are some basic commands you will likely use:    ideal (f_1, \\dots , f_n) will return the ideal generated by . Here products should be indicated by * , and powers with ^ . If you'd rather not use ^ (this might be nice if you have lots of powers), you can write ideal (f_1, \\dots , f_n) instead.     map S, R, (f_1, \\dots , f_n) gives a ring map if and are rings, and is a quotient of . The resulting ring map will send . There are many variations of map — for example, you can use it to define -module homomorphisms — but you should carefully input the information in the required format. Try viewHelp map in Macaulay2 for more details.     ker returns the kernel of the map .     I + J and I*J return the sum and product of the ideals and , respectively.     A = matrix\\{\\{a_1,1, \\dots , a_1,n}, \\dots , {a_m,1, \\dots , a_m,n\\}\\} returns the matrix      As in most programming languages, Macaulay2 follows the convention that the first position in a list is the th position.  The method primaryDecomposition returns a list of primary ideals whose intersection is the input ideal, and associatedPrimes returns the list of associated primes of the given ideal or module. Operations on lists are often intuitive. For example, let's say we want to find the primary component of an ideal with a particular radical.  i1 : R = QQ[x,y]; i2 : I = ideal\"x2,xy\"; o2 : Ideal of R i3 : prim = primaryDecomposition I 2 o3 = {ideal x, ideal (y, x )} o3 : List i4 : L = select(prim, Q -> radical(Q) == ideal\"x,y\") 2 o4 = {ideal (y, x )} o4 : List  The method select returns a list of all the elements in our list with the required properties. In this case, if we actually want the primary ideal we just selected, as opposed to a list containing it, we need to extract the first component of our list .  i5 : L_0 2 o5 = ideal (y, x ) o5 : Ideal of R  "
