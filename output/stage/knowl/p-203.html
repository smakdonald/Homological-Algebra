<div class="para">If one assumes the Axiom of Choice, this is the right notion of isomorphism of two categories (though not in the categorical sense!); better said, two categories that are equivalent are essentially the same. Note that this does not mean that there is a bijection between the objects of <span class="process-math">\(\mathscr{C}\)</span> and the objects of <span class="process-math">\(\mathscr{D}\text{.}\)</span> In fact, one can show that a functor is an equivalence of categories if and only if it is fully faithful and essentially surjective - though this fact requires the Axiom of Choice!</div>
