<div class="para">Localization is a very powerful tool in commutative algebra. Many important concepts localize well, in the sense that to prove that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> or a module satisfy a certain property, it is often sufficient to show that all localizations of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> or of that module also have that property. This is a very common and helpful technique in commutative algebra. For example, a module <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is zero if and only if all its localizations are zero; one can even reduce to showing all localizations of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> at a prime ideal are zero.</div>
