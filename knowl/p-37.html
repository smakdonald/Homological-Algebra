<div class="para">Most fields in modern mathematics follow the same basic recipe: there is a main type of object one wants to study - groups, rings, modules, topological spaces, etc - and a natural notion of arrows between these - group homomorphisms, ring homomorphisms, module homomorphisms, continuous maps, etc. The objects are often sets with some extra structure, and the arrows are often maps between the objects that preserve whatever that extra structure is. Category theory is born of this realization, by abstracting the basic notions that make math and studying them all at the same time. How many times have we felt a sense of déjà vu when learning about a new field of math? Category theory unifies all those ideas we have seen over and over in different contexts.</div>
