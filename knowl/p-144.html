<div class="para">A contravariant functor <span class="process-math">\(F: \mathscr{C} \longrightarrow \mathscr{D}\)</span> can be thought of as a covariant functor <span class="process-math">\(\mathscr{C}^{\text {op }} \longrightarrow \mathscr{D}\text{,}\)</span> or also as a covariant functor <span class="process-math">\(\mathscr{C} \longrightarrow \mathscr{D}^{\text {op }}\text{.}\)</span> If using one of these conventions, one needs to be careful, however, when composing functors, so that the respective sources and targets match up correctly. While we haven't specially discussed how one composes functors, it should be clear that applying a functor <span class="process-math">\(F: \mathscr{C} \longrightarrow \mathscr{D}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(G: \mathscr{D} \longrightarrow \mathscr{E}\)</span> is the same as applying a functor <span class="process-math">\(\mathscr{C} \longrightarrow \mathscr{D}\text{,}\)</span> which we can write as <span class="process-math">\(G F\text{.}\)</span>
