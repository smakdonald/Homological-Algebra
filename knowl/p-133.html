<div class="para">Note that the dual of the dual is the original statement; we can make this more formal by saying that <span class="process-math">\(\left(\mathscr{C}^{\mathrm{op}}\right)^{\text {op }}=\mathscr{C}\text{.}\)</span> Sometimes we can easily prove a statement by dualizing; however, this is not always straightforward, and one needs to carefully dualize all portions of the statement in question. Nevertheless, Sanders MacLane, one of the fathers of category theory, wrote that "If any statement about a category is deducible from the axioms for a category, the dual statement is likely deducible". One of the upshots of duality is that any theorem in category theory must simultaneously prove two theorems: the original statement and its dual. But for this to hold, we need proofs that use the abstraction of a purely categorical proof.</div>
